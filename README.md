Using NLP techniques to analyze customer reviews on Amazon.com
Sentiment analysis is a machine learning technique that uses computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) to identify opinions from large volumes of texts in an efficient manner. This technique can be used by businesses and individuals alike in making economic decisions such as; product purchase, competitor analysis, gaining customer insights etc. My purchase of the Anker Q35 Noise Cancelling Headpones during the recent Black Friday promo on Amazon presented an opportunity to apply NLP techniques while making a purchase decision. 

This project focuses on capturing customer sentiment on Amazon.com, the leading e-commerce webiste site. Instead of manually reading each customer's feedback, opinions from 300 verified sales transactions were minned and analyzed.
