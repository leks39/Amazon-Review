0,LightCC,"Note: This is specific to the Q35 headset with the most advanced sound and mic processing available in this headset line (in case it is mixed in with other Anker Soundcore headsets).SUMMARYOverall, this is a good - even great - bluetooth headset. But for meetings, missing a few critical items such as good low battery reporting, and especially a mic mute button on the headset really mar an otherwise great product. The gimmicky auto-pause feature should be off by default until it's ready for primetime and out of alpha/beta stage, made even worse by taking hours to get the app installed to turn it off. Furthermore the standard of being able to easily connect to two devices is not met here - you have to manually reconnect the 2nd device from bluetooth settings. If this headset was $50 I could still give it 4-5 stars for the value, but as a meeting headset, at this price, I give it 3 stars as the headset and app software currently stand.I really, really want to like this headset. It is a very good bluetooth headset in general, but for meetings/calls, there are some issues. For general music/audio playback, I gave it 5 stars on sound quality, and the controls are fine for that with both playback pause and volume up/down, plus different ways to swap between noise cancellation modes. All that works great, as advertised. The rest of the review will cover primairly headset usage.PROS:- The sound in general is good, with good noise cancellation. The ""transparent"" noise cancellation mode lets you hear everything around you well.- The sound processing of voice without a boom mic works great, with good noise cancellation of background noise such as typing, eating/drinking, TV in the background, etc. significantly or completely reduced. This works better than I expected - about as good as I was hoping.- The battery life is amazing. I haven't directly measured, but it feels like the claim of 40 hours with NC on is correct. See below on reporting though.- Connection distance of the bluetooth is great from my laptop. Definitely 50% to maybe 100% more than my other BT headsets. It's roughly 50-60 yards with a clear shot (from my front room out to the end of my driveway). I can go anywhere in my house, basement or 2nd floor, which isn't true of other headsets.- The over-the-ear setup and fit is decent overall (but see cons below). Do need to be a bit careful of it falling off in some situations.CONS:- My biggest con, and this takes away AT LEAST a full star. There is no mute button on the headset for the mic. This is just goofy to me. It's a bluetooth headset with an awesome no-boom mic voice pickup and great range. It's made for good calls/meetings - while roaming from your device. But no mic mute. In most conference calls (Teams/Zoom meetings, etc.), it is common practice to mute your mic when you are not talking. The entire purpose of a bluetooth headset is so that you can roam around when needed. That means I must have a mic button to mute/unmute myself when I'm away from my PC (or phone), directly on the headset. Whether I'm letting the dog out at my home (working remotely), grabbing a drink in the middle of a 2 hour call, or just walking around getting some steps in for the day during a call, I cannot afford to walk back to my PC to unmute. And if I'm unmuted, and the dog starts barking, or whatever, I need to be able to insta-mute from the headset. There are plenty of buttons, and maybe they could make a software update and allow you to configure this. I would happily give up the pause/play button for a mic mute button - or give up the NC mode button, given you can do that with the touch pad on the right ear as well.- This may only apply to fairly large heads (7 3/4"" hat size) - while the headset is big enough for my big head, it still applies a decent amount of pressure on the ears, and the ""heat up"" effect is very noticeable after about 30 mins to an hour. I do not find it comfortable to wear these all day and take a break from them whenever possible during a long day of continuous meetings.- Finding the app and getting it installed (or getting an account setup and verified) was a significant ordeal. I have the Android app on my phone now, still no PC app (does one exist?). This is a significant stain on an otherwise stellar product. There should be a product page that clearly lays out exactly what software is available for each product, and if you are going to require an account (why must you?), and you are going to require verification, make sure the process works flawlessly.- For powering on/off you have to hold down the button for an extremely long period of time. I think it's over 5 seconds. This is very annoying. It should be 2-3 seconds, tops. This is especially important in needing a fast power-up time if someone calls and the headset is powered off, for example. I don't believe the power button has any other function built into it, so I can't imagine why this is tuned to such as long time. This could potentially be fixed in a firmware update, if Anker is listening...- The gimmicky ""pause playback when you remove the headset"" is alpha-level software at best. There are times this triggers just wearing the headset and I'm fighting with the headset hitting play to keep a video running while it's constantly being paused. Thankfully you can turn this behavior off in the app - if you can get the app setup...- Unfortunately when changing noise cancelling modes, they ""announce"" the new mode when you change, which cuts out the sound from your meeting, video, etc., to make the announcement, so you miss part of whatever you are listening to when changing the mode (for example, to hear what a colleague is trying to say to you with NC on). Maybe this can be turned off in the app?  If not, that would be a welcomed additional feature.- A hiccup on the battery life reporting - it goes from ""high"" upon powering up to ""low"" fairly soon (maybe after losing 20% or so?) and is in the ""low"" range for a very long time. Then you get a ""beep"" when battery is close to out. You get 2 or 3 beeps total, but I think it's less than 30 minutes before it shut down on me after the first beep. They really need a different setting for when you get to 15-20% of power (that should be ""low""...), because that is where you should charge back to 80%+ for best battery longevity, and 30 minutes is not long enough advance warning when you can have 1-2 hour meetings. The first beep should be with maybe 5% of battery left (2-4 hours, given 40 total hours of battery), then make them progressively closer together as you get to 2%, 1%, 0.5%, ""shutting off now"", etc. Note that they do report the approximate battery level to my phone - perhaps you can get that in the PC app, if one exists and I can figure out where to download it from.- While you can pair the headset to 2 devices (e.g. laptop and phone), the device seems to only be able to connect to one of them at a time. This means you can't really switch to an incoming phone call from a meeting, for example. Or, even if you are just listening to a video or just have the headset on the desk, but connected to your PC, you can't pickup a phone call without opening your bluetooth settings on the phone and connecting. Then, to reconnect to the laptop, you need to open the bluetooth settings there and reconnect. I'm a little fuzzy on some of the details, since I've largely stopped using it for dual-purpose, but you may have to power the headset off and on again, then connect. This is all perhaps minor, but if you are going to advertise being able to work with 2 devices, it should work better than this.-FURTHER INFORMATION AND COMMENTS:Mic pickup and noise cancellation:I love the idea of using multiple mics (2) along with the other noise cancelling mics (4) in this headset to pick up voice from the user, and drown out other background noise - all without a boom mic! I tested this extensively by recording meetings in Microsoft Teams with just myself there, and tested the different teams noise cancellation modes along with this headset, while different noises were in the background - TV, typing on a quiet, but mechanical keyboard with different levels of intensity, and with different Teams noise cancellation settings.One thing for sure, do not use this headset and leave Teams on ""auto"" noise cancellation, or the ""high"" setting. Both of the noise cancellation algorithms together will create ""too much"" noise cancellation and drowned out your voice, causing semi-regular significant distortion when there is a moderate amount of background noise. Other people would complain that my volume sounded really low or that my voice was distorted, like there was a bad connection for a bit.I tested with the Teams NC set to ""low"" and ""off"". Low works well to add additional noise cancellation without adding additional distortion of my voice in my tests, and this is now the setting I've been using for a few weeks. This will drowned out light or moderate typing, myself eating and drinking, and all but fairly loud background noise. Setting Teams to ""off"" allows more to get through. You can start to hear moderate typing, for example (though it sounds very light, almost like small clicks). Either does a good job of reducing background noise while keeping the users voice in focus, without a boom mic present.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
1,Nhat Nguyen,"I've been shopping around for some decent LDAC enabled headphones to pair with my Fiio M6 audio device.  I previously bought the Edifier W820NB and they sounded quite decent for a lower-mid priced pair of headphones.  I had only heard of Edifier because I own a pair of their speakers, which I'm pretty happy with.  These were almost a keeper, but I decided to spend a bit more on something with more separation and crispness.I don't consider myself an audiophile by any means, but I'm all for spending a bit more for a clearer, more defined sound in my audio devices.  I have a friend who has a degree in audio engineering that always asks me why I spend more than I need to on my audio choices and I always ask him why he's so cheap with his.  I just always thought it was weird, considering his previously chosen profession.Anyway, I obviously had heard about the WF-1000XM4 and XM3 Sonys, but I wasn't sure I needed to drop that much money on headphones that I would only occasionally use.  Don't get me wrong, I love music, but generally, I'm listening to it on my turntable or in my car.  I just haven't found a pair of headphones that I'm comfortable wearing for hours at a time, these included.I read some other reviews about the comfort factor on these, and on that note, I was slightly disappointed, but not that surprised.  Maybe I have Elven ears and they just aren't made to house headphones for too long, I don't know.  Having said that, they're comfortable enough.  I didn't find myself fidgeting with the cups as much as I have others in the past.The box was well packaged and actually looked pretty fancy with a little sticker seal over some wax type looking paper to cover everything.  It comes with a USB-C charging cable, an airplane airline headphone adapter and a 3.5mm audio cable with volume control.  The 3.5mm cable seemed to be a little bit on the cheap side if I had to nitpick, but otherwise, it was fine.  I'd mostly be using it for the Bluetooth capabilities.  The case was pretty decent as well, although the plastic insert was kind of odd.  It looked like it was meant to stay in with the case, but it was so thin and cheaply made, that I have to think it was meant to be tossed.  It basically shows you how the headphone sits in the case and the reason why I think it was meant to be tossed is because under it, there's an etched drawing of how the headphones should sit in the case.  I'm getting the feeling people have tried to cram these headphones into their case in weird ways and end up complaining that they snap. :)Primarily, I listen to metal and all sub-genres of metal.  I almost bought some headphones called ""Heavys"" that were supposedly designed specifically for metal, but it was on a Kickstarter and I'm hesitant to go that route.  I'd rather wait to read reviews of it later after release and pay a little more if it's something I can't live without.  In the meantime, I wanted to try these as my brother bought me some Anker Liberty Neo earbuds a while back and I liked the quality of sound I was getting from them.  I'm not typically a fan of earbuds, though, so I use them sparingly.After charging the headphones to a full charge, I promptly booted them up, holding the power for 5 seconds to pair them with my Fiio.  It paired quickly with no issues and sounded an audible ""boop.""  I started playing a song.  I didn't have as much of an issue with the default preset sound as much as some others did, but I can also see how it wasn't everyone's cup of tea.After unsuccessfully trying to sideload the Soundcore app by copying the APK file to my Fiio (didn't seem to do anything when I tried to run it from the file manager), I decided to test out the multi-pair capabilities by pairing it with my phone to tweak the default preset.  While my test song was still playing, I double-tapped the power and successfully paired to my phone.  Unfortunately, as I was fiddling around, I bumped my hand on the headphones and it stopped the music.  I already knew that I would more than likely find the whole ""pause your music detection"" feature annoying.  I fidget and adjust the cups too much for this to be practical.  After the music stopped, I wasn't able to resume it and hear it playing for some reason.  It was paired to both my phone and the Fiio, it showed as playing, but no sound came out.I was fairly annoyed for the first few minutes of owning this thing, but I calmed myself, switched off the bluetooth on my devices, switched off the headphones and started over.  Then it worked fine.  I was able to load the ""rock"" preset and it stayed loaded after I unpaired with my phone.Even though my preferred genre of music is metal, I also listen to others, so I ran it through a battery of FLAC files ranging from Halsey/Clairo/Eilish/Adele/Juice WRLD/Led Zeppelin/Rush/As I Lay Dying/Heaven Shall Burn/Behemoth, etc.  Everything sounded excellent.  There was enough instrument separation, crispness and clarity for all of the different genres for me to consider this an acceptable pair of headphones for my every day use.  Will I eventually ""upgrade"" to the XM4's?  Maybe some day, but these were plenty suitable for my mildly discerning ears for now.Except for the weird little glitch where I didn't hear anything the first few minutes I messed with it, it's been perfect.  Honestly, it may not have been a good idea to still have a song playing while pairing another device and then accidentally activating the ""headset off detection"" feature.  About that... I read a few reviews stating that the same feature on the XM4's was a little sensitive as well.  Maybe this feature is not ready for prime-time just yet.  Not until we have a better way to adjust it?  I was thinking that if you can have the app adjust it, maybe you put on the headphones and tap something that shows it's firmly on your head.  Then, if there were a way that it would measure the distance between the cups and enable the pause when a certain measurement goes beyond that distance, MAYBE that would work. Not just when it shifts on your head, but when it detects both cups being pulled away from the ears.I'm more annoyed having my music be constantly interrupted than I am with having to press the pause button from time to time.  I mean, I'm as lazy as the next person, but c'mon.. do we really need this weird feature?",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
2,HJeffK,"I am a giant Anker fan. I have owned their cords and cables for years as they have always been high quality items at reasonable prices. A few years back, Anker branded their speakers and headphones under the Soundcore label. Soundcore follows in the footsteps of their parent company in making really high quality stuff at a great price point. These Q35's, while not as inexpensive as their prior models, are simply amazing. These are the first Soundcore headphones to offer the LDAC Sony codec which makes them capable of HiFi less compressed sound. You will be able to take advantage of listening to Spotify on the very high quality setting or, better yet, really hear Tidal Masters the way they are meant to be heard. I am not a giant over ear guy. I have a ton of ear buds. My wife has the world class Sony WH-1000XM3's which I have traveled with a great deal. I owned the Soundcore Q30s for a few days, loved them, and gave them to my oldest who was whining that he needed a pair. I currently own the Microsoft Surface 2s that I got primarily for working from home. Love them but the sound is just average for music. So, enter the new Q35's. I have had these about a week. Here is the breakdown:-Sound / App: It is amazing. One of the reviews complained about sounding muddy. I am no audiophile but I just don't hear that here. These are crisp and vibrant sounding. Yes, Soundcore does tune these to emphasize the low end a bit. They come preset to the ""Soundcore Signature"" profile. However, Souncore gives you a very robust app to work with. Just get in there and tune these to your liking. You can use one of their many presets or make your own custom sound. When you get these going with a high quality stream, at the risk of sounding overly dramatic, it is breathtaking. Listening to The National, The Eagles, and Metallica on Tidal all just sound incredible. Great lows, full mids, crisp highs, all of which are nicely separated and balanced. Beautiful to listen to. Also, when watching video there is zero discernible latency. Voices match what you are watching. Well done.-Battery life / Connectivity: Really as good as it gets. 40 hours or so with ANC on and 60 hours without. Just about best in class. Bluetooth 5.0 is here so easy pairing and rock solid range and stable connection.-Active Noise Cancellation: If there is an area to ding these, it is here. The ANC is good. Soundcore has been steadily improving in this arena for some time. It is not Sony / Bose good. However, for most, I believe this ANC will be more than fine. It should handle planes and traveling. The only things that really get through are sudden high frequency sounds. Again, overall good, but just not as spectacular as everything else Soundcore offers here.-Form Factor / Controls: The Q35's build is outstanding. They feel great in your hands. Not like $129 headphones should feel. I feel no discernible difference in quality from the Sony headphones. The controls are handled via physical buttons on the right can. The left can has power and the ANC toggle. One nice feature that Soundcore borrowed from Sony is that you can enter transparency by simply resting your hand over the right can. It's great! Something new I love is autopause. All my buds have this but I have never seen over ears use this. Simply slide a cup off of either ear and whatever you are listening to pauses. It is really helpful. My son walked up to me and began speaking. I didnt miss anything he said and didn't need to worry about pausing my content. Great addition! Soundcore also gives your a 3.5mm audio cable if you want to go wired. I haven't tried it here yet but it worked great on the Q30's.-Call Quality: The Q30's were nothing special with how they handled calls. The Q35's still aren't special but seem to be vastly improved. They have added an AI algorithm to the beam forming mics that seems to be more effective at isolating your voice especially in loud environments. I still get too much wind noise when outside but calls are solid and very capable here overall.I will update as I go here. For $129, Soundcore is offering you a tremendous value proposition. HiFi sound, good ANC, great battery, and tremendous build quality. If High Fidelity sound isn't your bag, get the Q30's. Same build, same ANC, and same great app, for about half the price. However, if you want to really hear music buy these, find some uncompressed (or less compressed) music, and enjoy. It really is something you need to hear.*Update* I have really been pounding these and didn't really say anything about comfort. They are lightweight and very comfortable for long term wear. I am a hot guy (sweaty not physically) by nature and these are warm but overly hot like so many over ears I have worn. I have had them on now for about two hours tonight. All good. I am warm in there but not too much so. Solid.***Update for later model Samsung users***So one really important note I just figured out thanks to testing the new B&W PI7's is that you really want to make sure you have HD Audio (in this case, LDAC) enabled on your device. Samsung actually deactivates it by default. If you go in to developer options, you can turn it on. Go to ""about phone"", go to ""software options"", and find your Android build number. Tap on that 7 times. Back out and go to ""developer options."" Connect your Q35's to your phone (or any LDAC capable headset) and then scroll down in developer options and you should see an HD Audio button. Slide that over to activate it and it should automatically connect to your highest possible streaming option that headphone offers. Don't worry, you will not hurt anything here. Get your Tidal account going or move your Spotify quality to ""very high"" and you will be off to the races. Game changer for me and my S21 Ultra!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
3,yuuxno,"Well, the sound quality is excelent, but the mic on it is so bad... also, the range of connection is sooooo SMALL, when i walk to my living room (aprox. 15 meters away from my laptop where the headphones are connected) the audio starts to cut or glitch. And i get it, but apart from stopping the audio, it creates a loud sound and it's so annoying. When the headphones are connectedd via bluetooth, turning the volume down does not work if you do it on the device, just with the buttons on the headphones (at least in my laptop). The battery can last several days, probably like 4, on my experience. It comes with a weird adapter that i'll probably not use (provided in photo) and well at least the microphone quality on the cable that comes in the box is quite decent. When you plug your headphones like for the first time, make sure to turn the volume down at least to 20 because the sound was so loud i think i got my ears damaged. The only thing i hate is the connection range, really, it's awful. I had a sony WC-CH510 before this one, and i could go really away from my phone and it would be perfect, the audio could cut but it didn't create an earrape sound. At first, it had problems with glitching for no reason, the cause is the wear detection feature in the app! So if you experience that, turn it off, on the soundcore app, if it's not.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
4,HipGuy,"I use this headphone to connect to PC and Phone at the same time. on PC is for watching movie and meeting. Connection on Phone is for Hand free receiving call.Sound quality and ANC are working well for me. I use it in office environment. It help to suppress people talking noise. Microphone has good sensitivity. I don't need to speak loudly but need to remember to keep it mute when not talking.Built quality is OK. I found some imperfection spots on ear cushion. It is just uneven seam.The biggest issue of this headphone is at connection with 2 host devices at the same time. When it power up, it connect to only one of the host. It seems to be randomly connect to either Phone or PC. Connecting the second one is tricky. If it connected to Phone, Connect to PC will need Phone to turn off Bluetooth. After PC is connected Phone and turn on Bluetooth and phone will connect. The other case that it connect to PC first is harder to fix. It have to turn the headphone off and on.Wearing detection  does not work consistently. When it works, there are several seconds delay after take off from my ears. I think power button has only function to turn on/off. My previous headphone use power button as battery level checker when short press. Quick Transparency mode(touch on right side ear cup) is toggle on/off. In my opinion, it should be on when touch and automatically when stop touching.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
5,Nick Karstetter,"I have been trialing these headphones for the last three weeks. They aren’t the best, but for the price, you could do much worse.The ear covers are not the most comfortable, but far from the worst. By the type of material, I don’t expect them to last forever, but they are easy to clean and wipe down after working out or sharing.The quality of the sound is great, using it in my iPhone 12 Pro Max, Nintendo Switch, and 2018 MacBook Pro. I have used both the plug in option as well as the wireless, and both work fantastic. I have not used the plug in option during a phone call, simply out of ease of using them totally wireless. Some of my friends have said they can hear me much better without them, but I think any hands free device (headphones, earpieces, etc) that distance the microphone from right next to your face seem to lessen the quality. Noise cancelling, however, is 10/10, as is transparency. I typically use them in “regular” mode.The battery life is also impressive. I have fallen asleep wearing these, woken up, tossed them aside (sometimes forgetting to turn them off) and come back later after work to find they are still alive and working fine. A quick charge every once and a while, when I remember to plug them in, and they keep going without issues. I have yet to run them all the way dead.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. Hopefully when the ear covers wear down, I can replace them with something of a higher quality. Otherwise, great headphones and hard to beat for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
6,Weber713,"I use these primarily for work. This means a ton of confrence calls and music while I am working on things.  I have asked multiple people how I sound now thatbi am using these for my conference calls and they say they can hear me very well.  The noise cancelation and transpancy modes are great.  The microphone also does a good job of noise filtering too.  People I am on a call with don't hear the kids in the background or me typing.Tha audio on my end is great too.  I can hear every very clearly.  Music sounds great.  They are very comfortable to wear for most of a work day too.  They hold their charge very well.Negative- the headphones are hit or miss at being connected to two devices (my phone and my laptop). This is one of the perks of these headphones that made me purchase these ones.  If you use the sound core app to manipulate the transparency/noise cancelation then it kills the audio completely for the laptop. I find myself having to turn Bluetooth off on my phone to ensure I have a streamlined expirence using them for my laptop, which is not ideal but its not a deal breaker either.Overall I would recommend, with the understanding of the dual device limitations.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
7,DLBear,"Very happy. I'm not comparing these to the most expensive/highest rated known brand models, only what I'd consider the competition's ""mid"" level.  I wear these in an environment where they are not handled with kid gloves...  This is the 3rd set of ANC over the ear headphones I've tried over time (MPOW & Sony were the other brands).These outperformed a set of Sony WH-CH710N I received in:Sound Quality- much better as you can personalize it with the equalizer/appANC - way better, probably twice as effective as the Sony in the environment I use themBuild - seem/feel better built than the Sony model I hadComfort - softer material on the ear cushions, better seal around the ears too for meI mainly wear these in a heavy low-frequency motor noise environment (hours spent in ag equipment). Comfortable even after many hours.  The ANC is the most important function to me to drown out the low engine drone. It doesn't eliminate it 100%, but helps tremendously so that I don't feel like my head is humming after a long time spent in the cab.I don't like adding apps to my phone normally, but the app here is simple/straight fwd where you can change the equalizer settings to your liking, plus change the ANC response based on 3 environments. Even has an option to pipe ""soothing"" sounds (birds chirping, water running, etc) if you want to for relaxation.As far as using it for phone calls, callers on the other end said they could understand me fine... I'm not on the phone much though when using them.I actually like the physical buttons on the headphone to control it rather than supposed intuitive swipes/sensors/proximity gestures that some manufacturers think are cool just because they can do it.  Didn't take long to use these control buttons without any frustration of trying to find them...I'm not getting paid for this as some reviews admit... Just trying to help someone else that may want something for a similar situation.I will edit this review if my experience changes.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
8,Ryan,"Comfort and Fit:This product is very comfortable yet will fall of your head VERY easily if you try exercising with them (or even just bending down to pick something up). I tried using these for the gym and ultimately I just would not recommend. These are perfect for watching movies and sitting/laying somewhere. You could go on walks with these with no issues but running/weight lifting (primarily deadlifting and any exercise that consists of a lot of movement) on will make this a challenge to keep on your head.  Comfort is a 10/10, never get tired of wearing these and never get any discomfort. Fit is a 6/10 for how loose the headphones feel almost always and I have a pretty large head so I'd expect it to fit more tightly on me.Noise Cancelation and Transparency Mode:Noise Cancelation on these are pretty good. They for sure block out a lot of background noise and when you're listening to music, there's rarely noises that will break through. 8/10 rating for that. The transparency mode amplifies the noises around you very well and is useful when talking to people around you. 9/10 rating.Sound Quality:AMAZING sound quality. I feel as if I'm in a theater whenever I watch movies and listen to music. You can hear every little detail thrown at you. Truly worth the money for the sound quality. The only downside is there can be a lot of adjusting to make these sound amazing. I spent SOOO much time adjusting these to make them sound just as I wanted them to sound. The soundcore app just has so many different options for EQ settings that it can be a hassle finding the right one, especially if you're nitpicky (like me haha). For those wondering, I'd recommend the acoustic, piano, flat, or your own personalized EQ setting when you get the chance to customize this set of headphones. 9/10 for sound quality.Volume Control:The controls as shown in the photos I've included look simplistic yet they can be hard to remember which is which when using them while being worn. I have had these for a few months and still can't entirely remember the controls all the time. The touch controls as well as the headphones ability to stop the music/video once you take off the headphones is annoying. Had to be turned off. It's hit or miss with it for it simply doesn't work all the time. The touch controls also had to be turned off. Just found the button for NC was easier to click to change modes.Overall, I'd say these are a great set of headphones yet there are some flaws. The battery life is amazinggg and the quick charge feature is great. If you want a pair of headphones for relaxing and not exercising, these are for you!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
9,smfabac,"I bought  the Q35 after reading the reviews on Amazon.  My JBL E65BNCT head phone left ear hinge-pin keeper broke and JBL does not sell the hing-pin keeper (looks to be a 10 cent molded plastic snap in detail - shame on JBL).  I find the  Q35 ANC to be inferior to the JBL E65BTNC.  The only way I could test this is to back away from a kitchen sink with the water faucet running at full flow.  The E65BNCT ambient level (ANC on, no sound app playing) became silent at 9 feet back from the sink.  The Q35 became silent at 13 feet back from the sink. None of the ANC profiles (Transport, indoor, or outdoor) changed the 13 foot subjective distance from the running faucet.I like the ear-piece hing on the Q35. It appears to be more substantial then the hing on the E65BTNC.  The Q35 comes with a substantial storage/travel case that should protect the Q35 when taken on vacation.  The E65BTNC had a soft draw-string bag that offered no protection and requires you to carefully fold the ear-pieces to slip the unit into the bag.The Q35 head-band is not tight: I doubt that you could wear the Q35 while working out on a tread-mill or out jogging (two activities I avoid and have not tested).When wearing the Q35 in bed, I position the head band over my forehead.  That works well but if the head band is not touching my forehead and I get up from bed, the Q35 can slip and is in danger of falling off.I have turned off the sense function that pauses audio if the Q35 is removed from your head.  I found video and audio sources being paused annoyingly without removing the Q35 from my head requiring me to press play on the iPad to resume.When I first turn on the Q35 and start a YouTube video on my iPad mini6, the sound blares in my ears until I touch either of the volume buttons on the iPad.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
10,V Nelson,"My old skull candy hesh 2, started acting up and I really did not love the way they fit my ears, sort of on the ear instead of around it. Sound was ok, but it was time for the upgrade.  I never heard of soundcore or their products but decided to try them not expecting much.  They new headphones arrived in a nice hard case, with all the necessary cables etc.  When I first heard them I was blown away.  The blutooth headphone sounded nearly as good my old studio wired open back HD430...  The app also made tweaking the sound a very easy process. They also fit my head and big ears suprising very well.  They also have a sensor in them that turns off the sound when you take them off.  Very cool idea.My only gripe are small control buttons.  I wish they were more pronounced and distinguishable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
11,Justin,"These sound fantastic. Amazing for getting work done in your own world in public spaces or drowning out distracting home office noises or just listening to audiobooks or music while cooking or doing chores. They drop out the background noise floor very effectively so you can listen at a low volume level and preserve your hearing while experiencing subtle details.Some people complained about the smell in other reviews. I have a very sensitive nose and am very cautious about off-gassing, and these had no smell problem at all.I was a little disappointed initially as I learned that bluetooth degrades the audio quality for calls (it has to split the same amount of bandwidth for two audio streams - your voice and the incoming audio - so it halves the quality). But there are workarounds if that bothers you when on calls. 1) use the headphones in wired mode with in-line mic, 2) remain wireless but just use the internal microphone of your laptop or phone if the app allows input device selection that's different from the output, 3) keep the headphones in wireless mode, but plug a $5 lavalier mic into your laptop and clip it onto your shirt 4) just deal with the degraded audio for the duration of the wireless call. IMPORTANT NOTE: after the wireless call is over you may have to manually switch the input back to internal microphone to get your high-quality wireless audio back. This happened to me with MacOS.The 2 device connectivity (Android phone and Macbook) has been pretty good. Sometimes I have to manually tell it to reconnect to my laptop or phone when I turn them on, sometimes it connects automatically. It's a minor inconvenience. To switch between the two devices you pause the audio on the current device and then start playing some audio on the other device. Sometimes I have to press pause and play a couple of times before it switches, but it's no big deal. It never will play both simultaneously. It's one or the other.The battery life has been phenomenal.All in all I'm thrilled with the value here and the huge upgrade that these are for my productivity and listening enjoyment. I also believe that they will help save my hearing in the long run by allowing me to keep the volume low while still hearing all the details.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
12,Edward Zhou,"The noise cancel is selective i thing to some frequencies.  I didn't really notice it at first, but when i took these off the first time after a few hours of use, i realized it was storming outside.  The strange thing is, the noise from my actions moving stuff around was somewhat audible, but the rain and wind slamming on my window weren't.  All in all 9/10 for the base price (10/10 for black Friday).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
13,Real reviews by me,"This is my first set of over the ear noise canceling headphones. I must say they sound remarkable and although the Bose and others may sound a bit crisper for lack of a better word, I couldn’t justify spending $350 on a pair of headphones.At $110 these headphones sound on par with those other higher end head phones.Customer service is top notch. The ear pads started to wear badly on mine. I contacted customer service and they promptly sent me out a new pair of ear pads to replace mine. Now the headphones look as new.I highly recommend this vendor",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
14,Kyle Archer,"The Soundcore Life Q35s are an insanely good deal for the price point. I was looking for a set of Bluetooth cans that support LDAC without having to shell out some serious cash on the Sony WH-1000s.The sound quality is fantastic. I've noticed some reviews mentioning the loud bass. The default EQ is indeed quite bass heavy but the Soundcore app features a large selection of EQ presets as well as custom capability. After some browsing and tinkering I created a custom EQ that sounds exactly right, with some of the sub bass rolled off and 100-200 Hz boosted for some good punch. The thing is the Q35s are capable of reproducing bass at many different frequencies, instead of just that generic muddy boom bass that you hear in Beats or cheap brands. The key is to find an EQ that balances those bass frequencies to your liking. Beyond that the mids have wonderful presence and an immersive soundstage. They remain wonderfully distinct from the bass frequencies. Treble is clear and detailed without fatiguing the ears. The high frequencies are pushed behind the mids to create the perfect balance of clarity and softness. I think Boss does this slightly better but Boss doesn't feature LDAC as a Bluetooth option. When LDAC is engaged on the Q35s the sound is hard to believe for wireless.I don't take my Q35s out of my apartment but for inside use the ANC works perfect. The hum of my swamp cooler, fans, or any low ambient sound is almost totally muted. I've heard the ANC falls short when used out in public and that the Sony WH-1000s are better. That wouldn't surprise me, they're nearly three times the price of the Q35s. But for normal indoor use the ANC is great.Battery life is insane. I charge them a few times a week (I'm neurotic about having full charged batteries, total OCD) but everything I do they're already at 70-80%. I basically top them off every couple days for an hour or so and literally never worry about running out of battery. I could be lost in the woods for a week and these things would last the whole time, probably outlive me. The build quality is awesome too. I'm not worried about these things snapping or cracking and the lack of a cord means I also don't have to worry about snagging the cord on a doorknob and having them violently hurled across the room right before the best part of the song hits. That was the absolute worst.If you're phone supports LDAC I can't recommend these enough, some of the best money I've ever spent.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black

Quality surround sound, extreme comfort, noise cancellation and more... all in one package, for a fraction of the cost of other headphones. Fast Bluetooth connection.....

Minor inconvenience compared to the many advantages of having these.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Pink
17,Kevin S.,"I wrote out a very long and detailed review, but my phone died and I'm not typing it again so here are the cliff notes;-noise cancelling is extremely intuitive and transparency mode blocks out chatter while focusing on voices. Full ANC causes near perfect silence, but I can still hear things like sirens and such.-Sound quality is incredible. I have used WAY more expensive headphones that didn't sound nearly as good as these. Under $200, the only other headphones that compare are the soundcore Q45's and those are only marginally better.Bottom line, these should cost $300. They COULD cost $300 and nobody would bat an eye. Get them, you won't find this quality until you get over the $300 line.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
18,Rocky Mtn Fam,"I've heard great things about Soundcore and these headphones are pretty much exactly what I expected. The default sound signature is great and you can always change it up in the app. The ANC works as well as in-ears for a similar price point, though the difference between modes is subtle. I'm big on lossless audio and don't notice any difference in sound quality between Bluetooth and wired modes. I'm not sure how much of an improvement LDAC is, though, since I don't have a reference point.Based on what I've read, most the pros for the Q35s apply to the Q30s as well. I'm not sure if spending an extra $50 was worth it since these still have a few key downsides. While these headphones are comfortable, the padding isn't thick enough for that to last beyond a few hours. I also with that these folded more compactly and that the buttons didn't feel so cheap. Maybe it's just me, but tighter buttons with a satisfying click would've solidified the premium feel.Overall I'm really happy with these, but recommend going with the Q30s if your budget is mid-range.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
19,Brian Di Noto,"If you want a pair of hood sounding headphones for under $100, then these feel like a great choice.  I was considering the new 1000m5 or AirPod Max, but no way can they be 4-5x better than the Q35. Double, sure, but I couldn’t justify blowing that kind of money on headphones that have kind of similar complaints in the reviews.  I did try the Q30 as well, but I wouldn’t bother with those. Noticeably less comfortable padding and I have to throw shade on the claimed the Q30’s sound better than the Q35, just wasn’t my experience. I returned the Q30 and kept these puppies and use the Flat EQ setting on the app. ANC is good, not amazing, but keep the price in mind. Seems to kill a large chunk of background noise.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
20,tc54801,"I use these headphones mainly for listening to podcasts — shout out to Never Not Funny — and music during the course of my workday. I very much like that the app allows for changing sound profiles, and the ability to connect to the computer and phone at the same time is very convenient. Transparency mode also makes taking calls and meetings while working convenient by allowing to hear if I'm talking way too loud or way too softly.Having not had a Bose or Sony pair to compare these to, I'll just say that the noise canceling is serviceable and meets my needs: Along with music or white noise, they effectively block out any sharp noises from someone having what are sometimes loud meetings 5 feet away, directly facing me. For $350 or whatever, yes, I imagine the Bose and Sony options might have better noise canceling, but these Soundcore Life Q35s do what I need them to.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

(Using a Sound Mixer with multiple sources)Bluetooth headsets give me a bad taste - always had problems - these guys broke the mold.Very Happy - you will not be disappointed - and they take care of you in terms of tech support.Ok - replacing the headphone pads is a bit tricky - just need a butter knife and a bit of patience - but its wort the price tag in keeping comfort and functioning on my day to day work/personal life.Would buy again!

I ended up giving it one more go before I started my return and it started to charge! It won’t charge if you have it on. It has to be turned off. The headphones are comfortable. I’ve fallen asleep in them. They don’t squeeze your head and they cover my ears completely without being too big. Also my ear does not touch the mesh on the inside. These are great for someone who just wants a nice pair without spending a fortune. I honestly don’t hear much of a difference when it’s in normal mode compared to translucent besides that translucent has a little bit of a fuzzy noise. I don’t use the noise cancellation much but could see that it might come in handy if I was on a plane. Hope this helps.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

I could wear them all day, although the ear padding really doesn't provide much ventilation, and moisture will accumulate a bit over time.

32,Steve,"::Update 10-27-21::After the review posted I took a moment to look at the Amazon listing again and the color has been updated to Pink from White Pearl. Soundcore page also is now listed as Pink as well. Moved from 3 to 4 star.Let me start by saying that the 3 star rating is due to the color and the feel of these headphones. Not the quality of sound, battery life or comfort of the headphones.Cons:Color: These are pink. That may seem obvious from the pictures now but on both Amazon and the Soundcore the original pictures looked white. I would really wanted a more white pair but these are pink. The pictures, at least the main picture of the headphones, now shows they are pink. I do not like to return items that work well and I enjoy so now I have pink headphones.The Case: The case is not as nice as previous versions. I also have the Q20s and the case was a lot nicer. It has more of a matte finish that is easy to keep clean. The case for the Q35s is a soft textured outer shell that if you do get dirty you will not be able to wipe clean. Also the Q20 case is formed fitted to hold the headphones snugly in place while the Q35 is just a shell that you can keep your headphones in.Overall Feel: the Q35s do not feel as solid as the Q20s do. Even though the Q20s are over the ear their size is ever so slightly smaller than the Q35s and sit on my ears but that build makes them feel solid throughout the headphones. Also the Q20s just feel a bit heavier and more expensive. The Q35s feel a bit like there is extra plastic that if you tap on they just feel hollow, like the plastic is just for show.Pros:Sound and Multipoint Connection:The Q35s sounds great work really well with the multipoint connection. I stay connected to my laptop for work and my cell phone and I can seamlessly switch between calls and music all day.Battery Life:I get multiple workdays connected to two devices before I need to recharge.ANC:The ANC does a great job of keeping out noises from the office. I can hear all my calls clearly. Also not ANC but the microphones on these headphones do a great job of keeping background noise to a minimum and no one has a problem hearing me during calls.Comfort:These are very light weight and very easy to wear all day. The ear cups are large enough to go around my entire ear and are very soft. This is good because I wear glasses and I do not get any ear fatigue that I would have if these rested on my ears and glasses.Soundcore App:The accompanying Soundcore App is great. Very easie to use for the Q35s and all of their headphones and earbuds I own. One App for everything and you can just switch for whichever ones you are using that day is great. Also HearID, great equalizer, preset sound profiles and whitenoise to help you relax.With all of that said I really do like these headphones and would recommend them to others. Just be sure if you buy this color know that they are pink and the case is not as nice as their older versions.For reference Soundcore products I own:Q35Q20Liberty Pro 2Liberty Air 2 Pro",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Pink
33,Greg Klema,They are very comfortable and the factory says that the phone app will work with this Q35 as well as the 45. I did not try the factory work around to use the app. The Q20 had an electronic intermittent snapping noise. The Q35 has squeaky joints that you will hear from normal routine facial muscle movements. It is quite pronounced and distracting when listening to music. I returned them due to this defect. I inquired if there was a lubricant that could  be applied to the moving parts and joints to eliminate it but there was no response after over a week.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

37,J. Wylie,"These headphones sounded really good. The noise cancellation was good, the comfort was good, and the materials were good. However, I ended up returning them. Here’s why.The multipoint connection was problematic. I connected them to an iPhone and a MacBook Air. When listening to music on my iPhone, they would drop the audio for a few seconds every couple of minutes. There was no real pattern to it, but as you can imagine it was kind of annoying.Support said that there could be some kind of notification or wake from sleep on the MacBook to trigger this, but I never saw any of that. When I removed the headphones from the MacBook and just used them on the iPhone, they were fine, but if you want the convenience of multipoint headphones, your mileage may vary with these. It could depend on what devices you use them with.I picked up the Bose QC45 from Target. Same problem. Those were also returned. I ended up ordering the Sony WH-1000XM5, https://amzn.to/3XdL5E5. I know they are not even close to being in the same league as the Q35, but the Sonys had no problems at all with a multipoint connection.Like I said, everything else about the Q35 was really good, but I need headphones that work with the devices I use. The Q35 were not those headphones.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

40,Alexander Spagnoli,"I will preface that with the first pair I got I had some issues with connectivity (i.e. the headphones would start garbling when I would be listening or speaking either on the phone or with any application I was using. It would happen once every other day, so I reserved my review for when I got them replaced because beyond that initial issue, they worked great.)They sound great for their price and they are extremely comfortable. They stay on my head perfectly, even if I use them to fall asleep!I love the Soundcore app and it’s widget on iOS. It makes the headphones feel easily integrated with my phone.I put 4/5 for audio because they aren’t the absolute best, but for Bluetooth ANC headphones in their price class, they are excellent.5/5 for ANC. If I were comparing them to top of the line $500 products, then they’d be more like a 4/5. But for $110, they are amazing. I typically use the Transportation setting for everything since that seems to work the best all around.Barring any other issues, these will be my go-to headphones until either they break or until Soundcore, Sony, or Apple (not Beats) comes out with over-ear ANC headphones even more impressive around the $150-$200 price class, which I don’t see happening any time soon.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

43,Cronuscosmos,"This is my second pair of headphones I've bought from this company. The first ones broke the second week I got them. So I returned both. But Anker, being so nice I guess, let me keep the second broken one. They sounded great and was the best noise canceling headphones I've had up to that point. Gave those to my nephew, however. Now with months going by and me buying another brand that was NOT Anker, which incidentally also broke on me. They sounded great as well but the material design was terrible. This time I did research and found that this brand, The Soundcore Q35, is exceptional with its noise canceling and sound quality. It should be since it's twice the price of the previous Anker models I got from this company. Though, and I hope I'm wrong, the Bluetooth cuts out in weird times. I'm using it on my Galaxy S22 Ultra so it's not an old device issue. I really love the feature where you take the headphones off and the music or whatever you're listening to stops playing. I wonder if this has anything to do with the feature of it turning off when you disconnect from your ears. I'm not sure. But if it continues then, sigh, I'll have to return another pair of headphones I really like but don't seem to be built well. Maybe someone's lasted them years. I'm not a hard-core listener.

And for me, this bluetooth headset is perfectly fine to use at night or on the go when you want to be handsfree.Battery life is great and the app is well designed. Some people have said they felt the noise cancellation wasn't the best. I think it's acceptable, it turns the real world down plenty for me. But I most often use transparency mode, allowing me to hear things around me, but not at a level that distracts from what I want to hear ie music or a phone call.There are only two issues that I've had: some important buttons are on the right side. Makes sense but I am left handed and my right hand doesn't have full motion, I wish things were made for left handers too. I get around this by using the app. And, a few times I have had people tell me they can't hear me on phone calls.

I can't speak to the noise cancelling and can't really say much about the sound because I only used them very briefly. The reason for that is that I bought them to use during my workouts and they were unusable for that purpose because as soon as I tried to do any exercise requiring laying on my back, they almost immediately fell off. That was a showstopper. They might be great headphones if you always use them from an upright position.

47,Nathan D.,"Pros:* These headphones are very comfortable and sound great.  I have a smallish head and dont' have an issue with them feeling lose and they definitly don't fall off or even move when I bend over.  My ears don't get hot with these either.* I work from home and use these for both music and meetings and the battery lasts for about 4 days of constant use.  When you need to charge them, it takes less than an hour to fully charge.* Love the built-in EQ settings as well as the ability to create custom ones, which I prefer.* Can connect to my laptop and phone at the same time, so taking calls is a breeze.Cons:* The BT software gets confused A LOT and it's really annoying.  Somtimes, if I'm listening to music and then have to junp on a MS Teams meeting, the mic works and they can hear me butI won't be able to hear the other everyone else.  I end up having to disconnect and re-connect to make it work.  Today, I was listenign to music on the Windows Spotify app, had to jump to a MS Teams meeting, and then came back to Spotify but the music wouldn't come through.  I disconnect and re-connected but it still didn't work.  Even after powering it down and back up, music isn't playing.

Sometimes I'll make an adjustment via the headset and it won't do anything but then if I try to adjust the device I'm listening to, the headset gets the current volume of the device and switches abruptly to it, and it could be pretty loud.Still happy with the purchase.  If it wasn't for these connectivity issues, this would 5 stars, easy.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
48,Kelly R,                    The media could not be loaded.                 I Hope My Review Will Help In Your Decision On A Bluetooth ANC Headphone . Do your research and make the best buying decision .So I got these for the Bluetooth understanding the ANC would not be as great as my XM3s . The Q35 Sound Really Good Especially With The Custom EQ I got from OLUVS REVIEWS on YouTube . However Where These headphones really shine sound wise is when I power them off and listen wired using my set up of ZFOLD3 TO HIDIZS S9 PRO DAC AMP DONGLE TO Q35 . When I'm at home this is how I'm using them and the sound is just AweSomeNess PerSoNiFied . The build quality is standard soundcore excellent . The app is probably the best out there for head and earphones . I love the pink color and my friend he has the blue Q35s which he uses his even more than I use mine . I've heard the Q30 have a more balanced sound but can't speak on this accept to say that I love the sound quality of my Q35 . They are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time without fatigue to the top of my head or pain unlike the XM5s that I returned due to this but your mileage may very . While these are comfortable to wear not so much however if your a side sleeper who wears them to block noise . For this I have to use my XM3 over ears . I have to say I now prefer the Q35 sound to my XM3s so much so that the only sound coming from my XM3s is Sound Sleep . I want to try the Q45 next but am waiting for now .,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Pink

51,DEE-DOR,"Okay, this review is for the Anker Soundcore Q35 headphones. I am pairing them with my Samsung A71 smartphone using Amazon HD music service.Wow....These headphones exceeded my expectations. I have ignored bluetooth headphones for quite a few years now, being that I kept hearing about significant sound quality degradation as compared to wired headphones.My previous headphone ""rig"" was an Ipod, then my smartphone at the time (when services like Spotify more or less made streaming the main way of listening to music) , coupled with a 300.00 separate headphone amp. So, I would be relaxing on the couch or lying in bed with the following: my smartphone connected to about a 1 foot cable, which was then connected to my headphone amp input, then the headphone cable connected to my headphone amp output. Cluttered and complicated but...oh, the sound was so fine. I used pretty nice headphones such as the AKG 701s, and the Audio-technica ATH-M50X.Enter the Soundcore Q35 headphones with LDAC codec. I think this is the key. I am no audiophile, nor do I have ""trained"" ears claiming such.However, I'm pleased to say that with just my Smartphone, and these new Soundcore Q35's, the sound coming into my ears are just as good or perhaps better than my previous cluttered wired setup!LDAC coded? I'm no technical wizard but from what I understand, this is the highest quality way in which to stream your music, and its worth your while to use LDAC if you purchase these headphones. Don't automatically assume LDAC is going to stream once you pair your new headphones to your smartphone.There are YOUTUBE videos that show you how to go into developer mode (very easy) and enable LDAC.The whole process took me 5 minutes or less.So, the combination of Amazon HD music and the LDAC codec enabled is a winning combination for sound quality. Oh, and if you're a Prime member and subscribe to Amazon music for 7.99 a month, you can now activate Amazon HD music for no extra cost, just go into your settings. A no brainer.The bottom line: My Samsung A71 phone with LDAC codec enabled, Amazon HD music, and these new Anker Soundcore Q35 headphones produce the same or even  better sounding music to my ears then my old complicated wired rig! I would give these headphones 6 stars if I could.***Update as of November 6, 2022***Okay,  I still love these headphones after owning them over a year.  I bought the new Sony XM5 headphones when they were discounted down to 348.00I love these new Sony headphones but what's interesting is I'm still putting on and listening to my Anker Q35s and am still blown away by the sound.  Conclusion? If you're on a budget I really recommend these Q35s as they may sound as good as the Sony XM5s at less than third the price.I think? the Sonys sound a little better but honestly not sure as it's so close.Bottom line: these are a steal for the sound you're getting.  Oh, last thing.  If you have an Android phone,  learn how to activate the LDAC codec as I mentioned earlier in original review.  YouTube or Google should give instructions (easy) on how to do it. The upgrade in sound is worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
52,David M.,"As soon as these arrived, it was very simple to set up and start using. I know my phone supports the LDAC codec, so I was excited to try them out with the Tidal app. The audio has decent bass, though it was a little uncomfortable at first. I downloaded the Soundcore app to fine-tune the audio, and it now sounds excellent! The noise-cancelling feature will do the job, and it's good at it! There's also a transparency mode, which I think is clever and useful because it helps me be aware of my surroundings if I'm at a busy area. Even though I would probably use these more at home, it think it'd be great for the bus. My only complaint would be regarding the headphone-removal feature. It's a little flaky at times when it thinks I have the headphones off, and the music would stop playing while I still have them on. There were some reviews mentioning the ""bad"" smell of the headphones, but I have to say I kinda like it. It will fade away after a while, but it's nice to know how new headphones smell like lol. Overall, these headphones sound great thanks to its LDAC support and it's at a good price considering other LDAC headphones can easily go over $300!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black

54,Allan Simmons,"I bought these primarily for the gym, but I find myself wearing them around the house as well when I am cleaning.  Sound and NC are great.  I have heard a few that are better, BUT they are $100+ over the price I paid for these.  I got these for $90 on prime days.  For $90, they cannot be beat.  The only issue I have with them, is if I lay on the bench (like for bench press, not a nap) they slide back wards.  It is a minor inconvenience for the great price.  I would purchase again.As far as the sound, they sound great.  Best head phones I have heard.  There is an app also that you adjust the EQ.  It is pretty sweet.  I have used these just to put on, play something relaxing and sit under the AC to cool down.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
55,MP,"I really wanted to like these headphones, and I splurged the extra $50 over the Q30 even though I primarily exist in the Apple ecosphere and I knew LDAC wouldn't do anything for me, thinking a newer generation gives fewer opportunities for bugs and kinks. I think they still aren't fully cooked yet, and I don't want to wait on firmware to get it sorted out, so sadly I'm sending them back.The good: The build quality is great. All the materials seem top-rate. The metal headband is a very nice anodized looking brushed material. All the plastics look and feel upscale and solid, not cheap at all. The ear cups have good memory foam and are extremely comfortable to wear. The head padding is a different, more traditional-feeling foam material, but cushions quite well. Overall, the fit and finish of these headphones are above average.The sound, of course, is what's really touted on these and when it sounds good, it sounds great. The extra EQ functionality in the app is an appreciated feature, and it's not hard to get bass, mids, and trebles dialed in to your liking. I didn't love any of the preset EQ settings, and many of them sound pretty hollow to me, but that's fairly easily overcome if you don't mind tweaking with the equalizer for a while. Took about 20 minutes total, and half a dozen different styles of songs to find settings I really liked.The carrying case is a nice touch, though I don't imagine I'd ever use it. If that's something that might sway your consideration, be aware it's a solid and nicely done addition. The packaging, if you care, all seems very premium. I didn't spend a ton of time with the controls on the phones themselves, but they also feel solid, though not without some serious issues I will mention below.Overall, this feels like a really well done and an extremely affordable option that doesn't feel cheap in any way.BUT....The bad: I could ignore the Dollar Store Beats looking logo if they performed better than they do. When the sound is good, as I said, it's great. If only it would stay that way. I have been using these for work calls, just to get used to sound and mic quality. At first I was happy. No one shared negative feedback on the mic quality so I assume it is fine, but the sound on my end kept jumping back and forth from normal to sounding like I was talking to mid-80s robots. I was able to temporarily fix it by disconnecting and reconnecting the headphones, but that simply isn't a realistic long-term option for me.While out walking the dog, I had the headphones stop playing my podcast on my iPhone several times. It happened a couple of times when I was adjusting the volume and mode settings, where it would just stop and I had to restart. It also did it on its own a few times, with no obvious outside stimulus. I have NEVER had a problem with this with any other earphone I've used. Even cheap ones, which these are not.I didn't find the ANC anything to be wild about. In fairness it's not the primary reason I bought these, but if I were to have been seeking it out, I have no doubt I'd be extremely disappointed. I walk on a fairly heavily trafficked road and the car noise between ANC and normal was barely noticeable. It's mostly like someone turned down the background volume a little bit and then dropped some light white noise on it. Maybe that's what people expect out of ANC, but I wasn't wowed by it at all.Also, I found the Wearing Detection feature to be inconsistent, and it only seemed to work about half the time. When it did work, it took a good 3-5 seconds to pause. The rest of the time, it just kept playing, or would restart shortly after pausing. Not a primary feature that drove my purchase, bit if it's going to have it, it should work right.So in summary, I think there is probably a really good headphone in here trying to work its way out, but I am entirely underwhelmed by the product they brought to market. It all feels very much like it needs a few more months to hammer out software issues. In fairness, I have no doubt, because it's newish and because it's a flagship product, they'll release firmware updates to address many of my concerns. I just don't like paying full price to beta test.I rated these a two, but they're likely more like a 2.5. An eventually really good product that needs work. I will be returning them. Hopefully the Liberty 3 Pros that are charging on my desk at the time of writing turn out to be a little more well done while I continue to look for over-the-ear wireless headphones I really feel good about keeping. For the most part, I am a fan of Anker and Soundcore, and I have several of their products. This one just misses the mark for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

57,Michael K,"First of all, I like these headphones.  I like that they were cheaper than competitors.  I am enjoying them.  All of these reviews are talking about the equalizer feature in the app being neccessary.  Yup.  True.  The default settings are bad.  Even my untrained ear can hear that.  The other settings can make the sound good.  It is annoying to have to use the equalizer in order for it to sound decent.  One time I turned off my phone, and the speakers, and when I turned it back on, the equalizer settings had defaulted back to the signature sound.  I don't want to have to keep changing / checking the equalizer settings to make it sound decent.  If I want to listen to something on another device, I don't want to have to have my cell phone to double check these settings.  It is awkward.  The noise canceling is not as good as I have been used to with bose, but it is ok.  My audiophile wife had some interesting reactions to listening to these headphones.  The most unique thing she said was that the soundstage was different than anything she had ever heard, in a bad way.  She listened to The Planets (Mars), and said that it sounded like she was at the front of the stage, facing the audience.  She had this really weird confused/disgusted look on her face while she was listening.  She tried ""Staying Alive"" by the bee gees, and said it was the same feeling.  I was confused about which equalizer setting to choose (I hate choices), but I could tell that some sounded good, and some sounded bad.  But it was hard for me to choose which one sounded ""best"".  My wife's ear liked the ""Classical"" equalizer setting for both of the songs she played.  So I am happy I got these, and I am going to enjoy them.

76,Alex,"It's been a little over two months of wearing these headphones.PROS: I must say that they are pretty comfy and have good sound quality. I use them everyday for listening to music and as gaming headphones. I would highly recommend these as a great pair of wireless gaming headphones. You can also customize the EQ on the Soundcore app which will make the sound far better than what it does if you just use the default EQ settings. These headphones don't have the best noise cancellation feature (in order to get ""good"" noise cancelling, I have to turn the volume up over 50%), but they are pretty good for the price.CONS:The Soundcore app isn't the best on the market-- the features like ear detection don't really work great (when I turn my head the music pauses even though they are still on my ears lol).My issue is that after constant use, a small plastic piece fell out of the left side when I went to put them on. After thorough investigation, I think the piece came from the small notch where you are able to fold the headphones. Now the left side of the headphones is no longer secure when I fold the headphones. I'm worried that in a month or two these will come apart.Also, there is a loud glitch noise that happens every once in a while. Not sure if other people have had this issue, but it's pretty annoying.OVERALL:It's a shame considering I paid full price ($130) for it.

After this, I realized with chagrin that I hadn't had the PC using the mic correctly, so had left a bad review due to user error. This is edited/revised to update with accurate microphone review:The microphone's sound quality is noticeably different-than-normal to people when I use it for calls; however, while it doesn't sound the same as a telecom headset or normal phone headset for calls, its sound quality is sufficient for most communication. I prefer not to use it for business calls, but wouldn't hesitate to use it to talk to family while doing housework.The noise cancelling doesn't work as expected. I would characterize it as turning down the volume on the world and specifically on quiet noises, but not silencing anything, and only minimal reduction of louder sounds. For example, outside, it blocks the sounds of the birds and bugs, but doesn't eliminate the sounds of traffic or people talking around me - reduces them enough to focus on music, but doesn't eliminate enough to prevent you from hearing what's being said.The transparency sound, as is common with ANC's, is like playing the sounds around me at higher volume.Many people complain about the bass levels, though, and I haven't had any issue with the bass. I switched the equalizer in the app to the preset labeled ""Small Speakers"" and have enjoyed its sound with various styles of music.Overall, the audio quality played by the headphones is good, the noise-cancelling is enough to reduce sensory overload, and microphone is usable for casual purposes.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Pink

I am a dog groomer, so hearing dogs bark all day long gets old very fast! For the price of these headphones, you can’t beat it. The pink color is like a beautiful pearlescent.

85,Jennifer Bonham,It works well! Noise cancellation made me feel a bit claustraphobic but I found it useful with things playing. There is a pause music function when you take the headphones off or move one of the cuffs off. This can be accidently triggered by moving your head to much which can get annoying.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
86,Alex,"It's been a little over two months of wearing these headphones.PROS: I must say that they are pretty comfy and have good sound quality. I use them everyday for listening to music and as gaming headphones. I would highly recommend these as a great pair of wireless gaming headphones. You can also customize the EQ on the Soundcore app which will make the sound far better than what it does if you just use the default EQ settings. These headphones don't have the best noise cancellation feature (in order to get ""good"" noise cancelling, I have to turn the volume up over 50%), but they are pretty good for the price.CONS:The Soundcore app isn't the best on the market-- the features like ear detection don't really work great (when I turn my head the music pauses even though they are still on my ears lol).My issue is that after constant use, a small plastic piece fell out of the left side when I went to put them on. After thorough investigation, I think the piece came from the small notch where you are able to fold the headphones. Now the left side of the headphones is no longer secure when I fold the headphones. I'm worried that in a month or two these will come apart.Also, there is a loud glitch noise that happens every once in a while. Not sure if other people have had this issue, but it's pretty annoying.OVERALL:It's a shame considering I paid full price ($130) for it. I'm starting to regret not saving my money and buying a pair of Sony's lol. Lesson learned.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black

90,Yeppers,"I would like to start off by saying that I am no headphone or sound expert, but I researched headphones for weeks before I made this purchase and they have met (and in most cases surpassed) every expectation. These headphones are fantastic! I have had them for about 5 months now and they have shown no signs of wear or tear, despite me wearing them nearly everyday and taking them on and off very frequently. I know some people have said they have issues with the programing, but from my experience, they must have patch these issues with a software update.The cups have an interior dimension of 2-3/8"" by 1-3/4"" so my ears fit inside perfectly, something that was very important to me as it reduces fatigue and massively improves passive noise cancellation. The padding on the earcups also feels very premium. They sync up to Bluetooth instantly whenever I turn them on, even for devices that are notoriously difficult, and the microphone sounds exactly the same as my smart phone (I tested it).The active noise cancellation doesn't do much for voices, but pretty much completely drowns out all white noise. If you haven't tried ANC, then it will be an eye opening experience the first time you turn it. I had to let everyone I knew try them on so they could experience it too hah!The battery life is of course, outrageous. I work at on office where I am constantly in video calls so I leave them turned on pretty much all day and still won't have to charge them for days at a time.To me the sound quality is also fantastic, and the ANC really makes listening to podcasts, music, and videos to a whole new level. Just be careful...with the combination of ANC and passive cancellation of the over-ear cups, you might have people sneaking up on you a lot more often, hah!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black

93,Tom ,"My previous noise cancelling headphone was the Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2. Only reason I bought a replacement was the ear pad was wear worn down and just recently realized that I could replace the ear pads. So, I'll be comparing Anker Life Q35 to that.Anker Life Q35 the bad:-You have to hold down the power button for five seconds to turn it on or off. When powering on, it will play a 3-note tone and announce the battery life (battery low, medium, high). When you power it off, it just plays the 3-note tone.-Wish it was clearer on what it's doing when you power off or on. Such as announcing, ""power off"" or ""power on.""-It should have a physical toggle power on/off button. Holding down the tiny on/off button feels like I'm doing it wrong, like am I holding it down too hard, too soft, am I holding it down too long or too short?-The power on/off indicator is right next to the power button and my thumb covers it when I'm turning it on/off so I have to hold down the power button a certain angle so that I can see the indicator.-When jack is plugged in the LED indicator doesn't work-The cushion that sits on top of my head is skimpy and I can feel it after long period of use.The Good:-Noise cancelling is great-I use it in video conference call and the sound quality is better than my Plantronics one. I'm able toconfirm this by using Microsoft Teams audio testing feature.-The earpad has a lot of room for my ears and band is long enough even for my big head (I have an unusually big head).",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

Saw that the Q35s were the newest model so I figured I'd give it a try.The TL;DR is that the Q35s sound better than the Q20s, both in music listening and call quality, but the noise cancellation is somehow worse regardless of the mode you put it in on the app.  It's unfortunate that the noise cancellation actually took a step backwards.  Reviews I had read prior indicated that it had improved over the Q20s but that is not my experience at all.  I can noticeably hear things around me a lot louder than with the Q20s on.It is nicer having an app with this pair, though.  The older model did not have any kind of app to make any sorts of adjustments.  Also, having an inline mic on the cord is great, as is the USB-C.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black

102,Bill,"I was introduced to Soundcore with the Life Q10, an upper budget tier headset that had an amazing battery, decent sound and fussy wireless connectivity.  When the Q35 brought the brand out of the budget tier, I considered its positive reviews reason enough to give it a shot.  They've certainly doubled down on their strengths, with another amazing battery, even better sound and somehow worse wireless connectivity.I'd really be shocked if Anker couldn't do a headset with a decent battery life.  While I don't want to underplay just how market leading they are in this area, I've come to expect this from them and won't dwell on it.The sound quality is solid for the price.  Soundcore products have a certain affinity for bass, which holds true for the Q35 too.  I was nonetheless pleased with the overall sound separation and clarity.  I toyed with the Soundcore app's accompanying EQ, but ultimately felt the hardware was usually at its best with its defaults, letting it be its bassy self shine through.I'm really close to abandoning the bluetooth connectivity entirely, and am glad it has 3.5mm to fall back on.  Of the first 5 devices I tried to connect to the Q35, only one accepted it on the first try.  Most took a double-digit number of attempts to pair.  Periodic disconnects have been common, even at an arms reach away across open air.  Bluetooth Multipoint is a feature in name only, as there's no convenient way to toggle between connected devices.  When it does switch devices, it'll sometimes jump to max volume and blast your ears out.  Bluetooth is a garbage standard and I hate that we live in the darker timeline where it somehow became the protocol of choice, so I can't fully blame Anker.  But as things are, this just isn't a reliable product.  Maybe firmware updates will improve this down the line, which is thankfully an option through the Soundcore app.The active noise cancellation is above average.  While the amount of noise it eliminates isn't significant, I give it extra acknowledgement for accomplishing it without a tight fit or obnoxious hissing.  The ANC system is operated by one button that cycles through ""Normal"" (off), ""Noise Cancelling"" (on) and ""Transparency"" (instead amplifies noise to simulate wearing an open-backed headset).  Each press of the button has a voice announce the mode it switched to, which makes going through them sluggish and disruptive to the listening experience.  ""Transparency"" is slightly more accessible in that you can rest your hand on the right ear cup to toggle between it and your other most recent ANC mode, though it still does so with the obtrusive narrator and is prone to accidental activation.  An ordinary switch would've been much preferred.Another feature the Q35 touts is a sensor that pauses your media when you remove the headset.  This is the kind of feature where the convenience can be rapidly overshadowed if it doesn't work right.  I'm sad to say it really does not work.  Listening from a stationary, upright position resulting in frequent false pauses.  It was infuriating and I ultimately turned it off in the Soundcore app.  An interesting idea very poorly implemented.As for comfort, the headset has large, soft cups and a very loose fit.  I found it fairly easy to wear for extended periods of time.  Though the loose fit does make it a less ideal choice for vigorous activity, and they can easily fall off when bending over or the like.I'll be keeping the headset, but I'm nonetheless disappointed in its shortcomings.

132,Bill,"I was introduced to Soundcore with the Life Q10, an upper budget tier headset that had an amazing battery, decent sound and fussy wireless connectivity.  When the Q35 brought the brand out of the budget tier, I considered its positive reviews reason enough to give it a shot.  They've certainly doubled down on their strengths, with another amazing battery, even better sound and somehow worse wireless connectivity.I'd really be shocked if Anker couldn't do a headset with a decent battery life.  While I don't want to underplay just how market leading they are in this area, I've come to expect this from them and won't dwell on it.The sound quality is solid for the price.  Soundcore products have a certain affinity for bass, which holds true for the Q35 too.  I was nonetheless pleased with the overall sound separation and clarity.  I toyed with the Soundcore app's accompanying EQ, but ultimately felt the hardware was usually at its best with its defaults, letting it be its bassy self shine through.I'm really close to abandoning the bluetooth connectivity entirely, and am glad it has 3.5mm to fall back on.  Of the first 5 devices I tried to connect to the Q35, only one accepted it on the first try.  Most took a double-digit number of attempts to pair.  Periodic disconnects have been common, even at an arms reach away across open air.  Bluetooth Multipoint is a feature in name only, as there's no convenient way to toggle between connected devices.  When it does switch devices, it'll sometimes jump to max volume and blast your ears out.  Bluetooth is a garbage standard and I hate that we live in the darker timeline where it somehow became the protocol of choice, so I can't fully blame Anker.  But as things are, this just isn't a reliable product.  Maybe firmware updates will improve this down the line, which is thankfully an option through the Soundcore app.The active noise cancellation is above average.  While the amount of noise it eliminates isn't significant, I give it extra acknowledgement for accomplishing it without a tight fit or obnoxious hissing.  The ANC system is operated by one button that cycles through ""Normal"" (off), ""Noise Cancelling"" (on) and ""Transparency"" (instead amplifies noise to simulate wearing an open-backed headset).  Each press of the button has a voice announce the mode it switched to, which makes going through them sluggish and disruptive to the listening experience.  ""Transparency"" is slightly more accessible in that you can rest your hand on the right ear cup to toggle between it and your other most recent ANC mode, though it still does so with the obtrusive narrator and is prone to accidental activation.

143,Knight,"I have owned Q20 and Q35; I use them mainly for business work and phone calls. No audiophile here.Cons of Q35:- No sound or audio over USB-C! Don't expect calls or listening to music over USB. USB seems to be only for charging.- Aux cable with mic is USELESS for many newer phones like Pixels or iPhone that do not have aux input.- Q20 had flawless Bluetooth connectivity. Q35 connects well with one device. My Q35 is having problems connecting to two devices. I frequently have to disconnect Q35 from one device to connect to another device.- No way to increase the volume (the mic sensitivity) for a phone call. The Q35 app or hardware buttons do not support this feature.Pros:-  The Q35 is worth the price for the call quality. The phone calls are objectively and subjectively better than Q20; I've verified this matter using Audacity; see waveforms. The sound quality here mentioned is mainly about the listener/recipient of your phone calls. As a baseline, the sound from the direct phone is louder with extra harsh environmental noise. Both Q35 and Q20 acceptably remove environmental noise in my office. Both Q34 and Q20 are not as loud as the phone's mic. However, Q35 sound is subjectively and objectively clearer than Q20. I have made 1000s of calls with Q20 and people often complained that they could not hear me as well. With Q20, people often asked me to speak louder. I've not received any complaints of call issues in over 200 calls with Q35 and call recipients of all ages. Nobody has asked me to speak louder with Q35.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
144,macinyourface,This is a great pair of headphones for the price your pay (I got it for $100).  The sound has a more lower end (bass) bias but you can change that with the Soundcore app equalizer to get more of the mids and highs.  Comfort is great and I had no discomfort wearing it for 2-3 hours.

The headset itself charges faster than my phone, 30% in 15 minutes if I remember correctly.-Can't connect to bluetooth while the device is on because: you hold the power button down for 3 seconds to enter bluetooth pairing mode..... but thats ONLY after you power on the deviceSo i have a cycle of listening to this headset on my phone, then going to my computer - turning the headset off(which takes 3 seconds) then turning it on and holding the power button for 3 seconds.Confusing and very annoying.-DOES NOT ""SEEMLESSLY"" CHANGE FROM ONE DEVICE TO ANOTHER. The bluetooth setting on your device will glitch out, which causes you to abandon the feature itself.

I have a larger head.Sound is great, might be a bit high on the bass but can adjust that in the equalizer.  I like lots of bass.  Very high quality for this price point.The bluetooth multicast seems to be messed up.  Maybe it is in general.  I had an Audio Techca before this that had issues so I sent it back.With the Q35 listed, I have had issues with:1. The volume buttons on the headphones was the only way you could adjust the level until I rebooted my phone.  SamSung A52 newer phone.2. The my phone won't pair with the headphones sometimes. I had to power cycle the headphones and then they paired.The button design is horrible.  Controls are poor.The NCF button is HUGE and the power button is small.  Have to hold 3/5 seconds power button to do most things.  Why not add a Off button.  I couldn't figure out how to skip a song, only to pause music.I am not sure I will keep or not, the sound is so good and these other issues are likely that bluetooth is just really bad, especially multicast.Want I want is rather simple it to cycle through 4 different devices.  2 computers and 2 phones.  I only really need one device active at once, but I have to turn off blue tooth on all the devices that I don't want to connect to the headphone except the one I currently want to use.  Otherwise if a different one connects first, I get locked out.Ok, current bluetooth issue is that I am on my A52 Samsung phone and also connected via Windows 10.  Sometimes it works to switch between me playing music on my phone and being on teams in windows 10.  Other times, it says I am connected on Windows 10 but I can hear anything.The same is true just being connected on  A52 samsung phone.  I have the soundcore app installed on my phone.I really don't want to send them back as the sound is so good but it's heading that way now.

151,Shutterbugg,"I want to preface my review with the fact I am not an audiophile but I do appreciate good sound quality and other benefits of using headphones with your phone, like hands free phone calls. I use my headphones for three things - music, YouTube and phone calls. Sometimes texting isn't an option.On the music and YouTube front they are a solid 3.5 to 4 stars. They sound very nice, almost as good as my Bose headphones. The noise canceling is there but not as strong as my Bose, which is fine since these aren't $300 either. I usually control my volume on my phone but that feature is not available with these headphones, I have to adjust the headphones themselves. This isn't a huge deal it's just noticeable. They seem to run a tad bigger fit wise as well, which again isn't a deal breaker and could actually be a good thing for you, just depends on the size of your head. I get lots of slipping when I am moving around a lot.On the phone call quality and ease of use is where these really stink. I'd say 2 stars total if I had to rely on these for all my phone calls. I've updated the Bluetooth, the app that controls the headphones and I am constantly dealing with dropped calls from these. I can be doing any activity and listening to music, get a call I actually have to answer and these drop the call each and every time! It's fine if I wanna screw with telemarketers but trying to actually have a conversation these are not trust worthy. It's quite frustrating for me at least.They are solid if you want headphones for music or traveling. If you want these for phone calls be aware this happens - the Bluetooth fails. My Bose do not drop calls like these do. I have had these since Christmas 2021, it's the end of July 2022. I'd say I've given them a fair try but I do regret my purchase as they don't perform well in my life.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

153,Juan,"For the price there is no way you can go wrong! For starters if you were looking at any beats headphones don’t even think about it and go for these. The sound quality is what makes this pair of headphones shine, though to get this they had to cut corners with the buttons and build quality. Even if they cut corners here it still feels better quality than the whole beats lineup and most headphones and could be compared with Sony’s xm4’s. The ANC is lacking though, it’s not as good as flagship headphones but it still works quite well and can block out around 80% of what the Sony’s can but for the price you can’t beat it. Comfort is also very good since they are not heavy at all  and don’t clamp hard over your head and I say that I can wear these all day without getting tired of them. Overall these headphones are very, VERY good for the price and for being an anker product it’s not surprising since they consistently take out quality products at a good price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black

156,Gretchen Jackson,"I bought this for the high quality mic. It has two mics and sophisticated AI for managing the microphones. After I bought them and tried them I was impressed for a while because it doesn't pick up like ANYTHING else but your voice, even if there are people right next to you, which is great!But.1. It has this annoying habit of randomly turning itself off, usually in the middle of a phone call with someone which is especially annoying because I'm usually driving. The whole point is I'm trying to be hands-free...now I have to figure out what's happening (which is not obvious because it doesn't even play the powering-down-sound when this happens), then turn them back on, then go to my phone and have it select the headphones again.2. It frequently will randomly play a sound, the quick two-beeps sound, that for any other headphones in the world, that sound means you're getting a call...but for these it means absolutely nothing (that I can tell).3. It will have great audio quality most of the time, but then randomly, usually once every three conversations or so, it will start producing REALLY LOUD feedback that always makes the other person be like ""uh dude something is terribly wrong what is that loud sound."" The solution is you have to toggle from having your phone use the headphones to normal and then back to the headphones. Sometimes that doesn't work and you have to turn the headphones on and off again. All while trying to drive hands-free and be safe...this just doesn't work. I can't be doing this all the time.It's a shame because this has other great features. It comes with an app where you can mix your own whitenoise/ambience mix.

157,Michael Mercier,"These headphones have a warm, detailed sound that makes any music more enjoyable. But you you couldn't say the sound is natural. I think they were engineered to have a particular, pleasing soundscape.One of the You Tube reviewers dwelt on the heavy bass of these phones. Indeed they are too bassy as delivered. However, you can fix this in the graphic equalizer of the phone app. And you should. Trimming back the bass gives them a more natural sound.I think the heavy bass was a conscious choice -- a persistent bass tone is one of the cornerstones of noise cancelling.  Regardless, the ANC is good enough, especially for a third of the price of the big-name brands.The detailed soundscape adds atmosphere to  movies. The positional audio is good too.They fit me well and are not too big or heavy. Love 'em!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

159,Dmitry,"I bought these because I didn't want to spend the money on the premier brands, like Sony or Bose.  I am not a professional musician and my ear isn't as discerning.  $300 for a pair of headphones didn't seem like a good spend to me.  I ended up with these Soundcore Q35 headphones which suit my needs very well.Noise cancellation:  Overall it works pretty well.  Is it perfect?  No.  I can still hear mechanical keyboards and faint voices of people's conversations bleed through.  If I turn my music up a bit, the NC works just fine for my needs.Sound:  The default sound profile is pretty bad, as others have pointed out.  Luckily, the Soundcore app includes an EQ.  I ended up with the Electronic preset for most of my day to day listening.  I think it sounds pretty good.  One of these days, I'll make a custom profile to see if I can tune down some of the favoritism for bass that these headphones seem to have.  The headphones are equipped with the LDAC codec.  I've made sure to configure my Pixel phone to use LDAC, but like I said, my ear isn't discerning enough to spot the difference.Battery life:  This is fantastic.  Between my Zoom meetings and listening to music, I can definitely get a few days without having to worry about charging them.Calls quality:  Haven't had any complaints here.Multiple device connectivity:  This works great. I can seamlessly switch between two devices.Wear detection:  This is pretty bad.  If I lean my head down to look at my phone, music gets paused.  There needs to be a way to tune this feature.  I'll probably end up turning it off.Comfort:  They are very comfortable.  I can walk around in them all day.Build quality:  They are plastic of course, but appear to be well made. They come with a hard case, which is a bit on the larger side.Overall:  I think that if you can get these headphones for around $100 on sale, they are a solid buy.  The only missing feature for me is the lack of AptX codecs to decrease the latency a bit on PC.  Having said this, the latency isn't too bad.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

I am coming from Sony WH-1000XM3 and Sony sounds great, comfort level is Good, anc is awesome and the price reflects the product but Soundcore Q35 that is not the case.1. I am having issues connecting to Samsung phone, but had no issue connecting to Google Pixel 6 Pro. After spending 30 minutes trying to connect Samsung device via BT and NFC, I gave up and decided to connect with my personal phone which is Pixel and the headphones connect to the Pixel phone instantaneously. If you do decide to make a purchase of this headset, please make sure your phone/tablet isn't made my Samsung. What I am really impressed by is the app, and the sound Profile (more on that later) the app is spectacular, which is something you would expect from the likes of Google, Sony or Bose.Sound Profile: this headphone deafult profile is good and it focuses on vocal cords (treble) and the bass is low. I recommend setting custom profile. I set mine (V profile) and I was amazed by the driver's performance. They are just as good as Sony.AVOID purchasing this particular headset, if you wear glasses. I will be updating my review as I spend some more time with the unit...these are not  worth $129, this would be a great deal if these headset is worth $90-99 then I would 100% recommend this device.Good luck folks...Anker Soundcore is doing great things, it is just not there yet with comfort level and connection issues with Samsung can ruin the purchase.Suggestions: add onboard storage (on headphones), so when I go to the gym or out for a run, I can carry music without having to carry phone on me.

163,Dennis Mattinson,"I bought these to replace a perfectly functional pair of Sony MDR-10RNC wired headphones that have been my trusty travel companion for many years.  While the Sony headphones weren't the best dynamically, they were great for noise cancellation on commercial air travel.  However, I bought a new iPad that no longer comes with a 3.5mm jack so I figured it was time to go wireless.After reading the reviews on these, I figured I would give them a go.  I took them on a business trip that had me on 4 flights and also took them on a cruise vacation to watch some downloaded content when I was awake but didn't want to disturb my wife.While the noise cancellation is good, and the transparency mode is nice to have, the challenge with these is the auto-pause functionality.  To say it was an annoyance is an understatement.  Hit some turbulence?  PAUSE.  Look up from the screen for any reason?  PAUSE.  Flying in late spring through the Appalachians has some turbulence to be expected...these things would cause the video to pause every 2-3 seconds.  I was thinking, there has to be a setting to turn off this functionality in the app...NOPE.Another thing is the touch sensitivity on the side of the headphones to switch modes, if your shoulder or arm comes in contact with the right side of the headset, the modes will switch.Sound quality - its OK.  Not bad, not great.  Lacking bass but clarity is good.  Volume levels are fine to allow you to hear clearly on a commercial jet.But, they went back after my two weeks with them.  The challenges I experienced were too much to live with.  I instead opted for the Sony WH-1000XM4 which were on sale when I set-up the return for these.  Yes, the Sony earphones are more than double...but the quality and functionality is better and more in line with my use needs.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
164,Dave,"I have a few SOundcore headphones and they are all very good quality. I bought the Q35 because I have hearing aids and the Q35 work well with them. I also wanted something that could be hardwired via a jack. Voice quality of the microphones is good. Sound quality of the headphones are good too. I typically set up dynamic sound with my phone and my tablet (Both Samsung), so the EQ is set for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
165,angelo,"My 3-year-old headphone (taotronic) is now broken so I was looking for a replacement. At first, I chose the Q 20 but reviews on the Q 35 convinced me to take them instead. I just received them and decided to test its features. Right off the bat, I noticed that my 3-year-old much Taottronic, which I bought for around 70$ when it was on amazon, had better sound quality and better noise cancellation. The Taotronic headphone also did not reserve certain features for phones or computers. I was disappointed to see that this headphone is mainly for android phones. The app only works on my phone.With that said, I could overlook this restriction if its features worked properly. At first, the wear detection worked wonders whenever I took the headphone out of my ears while it is connected to my android. But then, after paring it to my computer and reverting back to my phone, I noticed that feature stopped working for no apparent reason despite it being turned on on the app. Furthermore, the play and the pause button is very buggy.  The device manual says that you only need to press it once in order for it to play a video or song. However, on both my computer and phone, I found out that I needed to press it multiple times for it to even play anything. Pressing it again would never result in it stopping/pausing anything.In terms of connectivity, I find these headphones also subpar. Connection to your device would start dropping less than 6 m away from it.  Lastly, the memory foam on the earcups is terrible. My ears started to turn hot within less than 30 minutes of use.Keep in mind I had these headphones for 3 hours only. Yet, I find myself having to not recommend these headphones to anyone unless if the ones I received were defective and the company is willing to send me another pair to try out. Until then, this is a hard pass.Update (4/10/2022)I have returned the headphone used for this review and got my refund. However, customer service reached out and graciously sent me another one free of charge. For this alone, I am bumping my score from a 2 to a 3 our 5 star. Great job! The new headphone seems to perform better too but several issues remain the same such as the fact that there is no app for a computer, connectivity issue, and so on.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
166,Don Van Atta,"The basic sound quality seems very good, and the headset is  comfortable to wear for extended periods. BUT inadequate documentation means I can't make it work for most of the promised purposes.---------------I'm an academic researcher and consultant.  I spent several years working in theaters doing lights and sound. I've done a fair amount of programming and written a lot of educational materials and manuals. I'm not young any more, but my hearing still tests out as very good.I bought these headphones because I find earbuds hard to keep on and uncomfortable and wires to my ears are annoying.  Normally I travel a good deal, so the noise-cancelling feature was very attractive.  I intended to use the headset when on platforms such as zoom.  I've used Anker-brand cables and powerblocks a lot and they've alway been high-quality, so the brand name also attacted me to the product.I haven't used the noise-cancellation feature on a plane yet, so I can't rate it.Fidelity of voice recordings and over-internet sound seems excellent. I do not use the headphones to listen to very high-quality musical recordings.I cannot use the headphones for zoom or phone calls because I can't figure out how to make them work consistently for those purposes.The headphones' functions are all controlled by buttons on the two earpieces.The app doesn't duplicate the on-headset controls. In fact, it seems to do nothing  beyond telling you whether or not the headset is paired and trying to sell you other products.  If the headset is not paired, the app just sends me to the Apple settings app.I cannot read the tiny icons on the earpieces, even after taking pictures of them and magnifying, nor can I  read the poorly-duplicated paper/web documentation, which mostly consists of a bad picture with arrows pointing somewhere sort-of-near the buttons and icons on the earpieces. I can't match the badly-drawn icons and buttons shown in the documentation with those on the headset.I found from trial-and-error that I understood the pairing sequence exactly backwards because of what I thought the docoumentation showed.Since I can't figure out how to make the phone features work consistently, I don't  use the headset for phone calls. Nor would I trust them in a videoconference.I shouldn't have to resort to trial-and-error to get minimal function from these earphones.Better documentation, or even taking the time to do a web page that does more than just duplicate the crappy printed pages would be a BIG help.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
167,Garfcadet,"I bought these Q35s for my wife as an experiment after buying THREE pair of Sony XM4s (for me, my mom and my daughter).  So I spent nearly $900 on the Sony's!!!  I wanted to see if these Q35s were at all comparable to the XM4s since they cost less than half of what the Sony's cost.  Much to my surprise (and perhaps dismay) the Q35s kept pace with the Sony's in just about every way except maybe noise cancelling.  And this is not to suggest that the ANC on the Q35s is not good...it IS good...certainly good enough for what most people are looking for.  The Sony's really have just about the best ANC tech on the market in the <$500 range.  That said, you won't miss the difference at all unless you happen to be an XM4 user also.  From a sound quality standpoint, the Q35s are definitely more BASS biased than the Sony's...but it's a fantastically CLEAN bass not a muddy annoying bass like so many other headphones on the market.  In fact, if your preferred music genres include Pop, EDM, hip-hop...anything with prominent bass and/or sub-bass...the Q35s will blow your mind.  The Sony XM4 offers a more 'balanced' frequency reproduction across the board and ARE extremely good.  But I think for MOST people, the Q35s are the obvious choice.  You're not only likely to prefer the default sound profile of the Q35s (and the phone app is also excellent, giving you all the EQ custom settings and presets you'd ever want), but you'll save $150 without sacrificing anything that you'd really miss vs buying the Sony's.  5 stars and 2 thumbs up!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
168,Andrew Mahabee,"Day 1:I would like to preface this review by saying that this is a day 1, first impressions review. I will update probably end of next week after I have used them more thoroughly and let my thoughts fully sink in.So a little about me and my use case. I have used a plenthora of headphone including but not limited to: Audio-Technica M50x, Sennheiser (cheap $100 over ears), beats, and now my current daily driver for the past couple of years are the Sony WF-1000xm3 wireless ANC earbuds. I primary wear them to the gym and at work to block out noise and watch memes in disguise (so they'll still be used at work). These Q35 headphones are basically designed to be my gym headphones because the earbuds are killing my ears from overuse.So my initial reactions are that I like the sleek stealthy look of the all black version. The logo in unobtrusive and sleek and the headphones feel of quality. They don't feel cheap and actually feel comparable to some $300 headphones.Pros:-- comfortable ear cups-- comfortable headband-- I like the controls-- NFC is nice to have-- LDAC actual produces clear audio and sound quality-- ANC is good but not superb, the seal definitely effects performance-- sleek and stealthy lookCons:-- ears sweat A LOT but that's true of a lot of over ears so I can't really fault them-- I actually wish it was a big more snug on the head. I usually wear a hat to the gym and it doesn't fit snug enough to block out sound. I therefore took off the hat and noise cancelling went up for me. But even then they still are falling up when I lay down to do bench.Overall, I am very pleased and am excited to report in the next week and even future.Stay tuned friends!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
169,Jonathan Hjelm,"I own a pair of the Q20 headphones - which I have given to my daughter for her to use. The Q20 headphones are a perfect balance of price and quality. Based on my previous experience with SoundCore, I thought I'd give these Q35s a try.Bottom Line on Top: Meh! I have used the Q35s for about two weeks now and I have to say that I will be returning them to Amazon because there are simply better options available at this price point.At this price point (about 100 bucks) the Q35 begins to compete with mid-to-higher-end alternatives which might offer a better value and audio experience.For my grades below, I set the EQ to flat and turned off the noise-canceling features.Music Playback = B. Decent midrange to high range. The sound is clear and articulate enough, but the bass is a bit muddy.Phone calls or video calls = B. Call audio is not a strength. The sound is tinny and weak.Built-in mic for calls = B. Pretty clear mic audio pick-up.Pure Noise Canceling = B. Noise isolation and reduction are fairly good and effective at canceling out mid-to-high frequency background noise. The ANC mode also provides a very pleasant white noise.Noise Canceling with music playback = C+/B-. Not good. The audio is muffled and muted as you would expect.Phone App = Very basic control but easier to use than the onboard controls built into the headphoneBattery Life = A. Charged it once and it has been going for a week.Wear detection function = It works but it is a bit glitchy. Yes, if you take the headphones off the audio will stop, the problem is that if you move your head too much (i.e. get up from a chair) it will also turn off the music.Comfort and fit = B. The synthetic leather feels a bit cheap and not as comfortable as I would expect. The headband fits fine.Bottom line. Save your money and go with the Q20s or spend a few bucks more for a better set of headphones. Simply put, the Q35 is not worth the extra money and at this price point, there are too many better alternatives. I am sending this back to Amazon today.Best wishes!",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
170,Sarah Cooper,"Sound quality is decent. Noise cancelation pretty good. But if it's quiet, there is a constant electrical hum. They loosened up after a few days of wearing them. The ear pads are too soft and the adjustable head piece is not sturdy. I have a small head and leave them on the smallest adjustment, fit great the first day and a half. But I literally felt when they gave and loosened. Also, if you have gages or decent sized earrings, you have to take them out for them to fit properly. You also can't wear a hat or they don't sit flush on your head which ruins the sound quality and noise cancelation. I wouldn't spend this much money on these again. Which is a shame because the features and the app are pretty nice.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
171,Tiffany,"I really like these headphones! I did a ridiculous amount of research before landing on these, after spending forever deciding between these and the Q30s. I'm happy with my choice (I'm sure the Q30s would have been great too).The main reason I ended up going with these was the fact that you could use the mic while wired up, and that the mic was supposed to be better, since I was going to primarily be using these at the office and for meetings.The mic seems to work pretty well for me! From what others have said, I sound just fine. No complaints here from me.The audio is nice, although I admit I'm not an audiophile so my bar might be on the lower end. But I can hear all of my music and calls clearly, so no complaints!For my purposes (again, mostly in an office environment), the noise-cancelling works great. I can definitely tell a difference between when I have it on and off.I've connected the headphones to 2 different Bluetooth devices and it does a great job with that.And finally, they're really comfortable! I have a small head, and at the smallest setting, they aren't really squeezing my head, but fit comfortably. The ear cups are plenty large, and I can easily leave these on for hours at a time without issue.I've only been using these for a couple of weeks, so I'll have to see how they hold up. But for now, so far so good!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

175,Old Frog,"I was an early adopter of these phones receiving them on 28 APR. I have older BOSE noise cancelling headphones and IEMs; very pleased with them. I was looking forward to seeing if there had been advances in performance along with a lower price. I am pleased with the noise cancelling quality. However I soon experienced the ""LDAC noise"" issues with pops, pauses and some scratchiness. It was fine on APTx etc. But I experienced the issues on: Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, Fiio M15, Fiio M11 and M11 Pro. I contacted Soundcore/Anker on 2 MAY which began a four day dialogue. They expressed their sorrow for the sound issues and promised help, and also refund if solution was not available.. First suggested was a 'forget', 're-set' of the phones and app. Did not help. They then asked for the serial number of the Soundcore app (not the headphones). I sent it off and they advised they would provide a firmware upgrade which was in the works. On 6 MAY I received notice from them that new firmware was released. I downloaded it onto the app of my Note and wanted to test it alone and compare with the 'not-uploaded' devices...but I found that all my devices had received the uploaded firmware update. It was - is - Version 01-18. OLD version was 01.11.01.18 fixed all of the LDAC issues except I heard a few - very few- pauses on the Fiio M15..it has two LDAC settings: 1) LDAC - Quality priority mode and 2) LDAC - Normal mode. The Normal mode was fine but the noises were on the Priority mode. I decided to give it some time ..and at this point the LDAC Quality mode appears to be - sound - fine.So, my review is less about the actual sound properties of the phones..with which I am very happy .. and more about the support I received from Soundcore/Anker. They went way beyond the call of duty in supporting me in timely fashion. There were 12 hour differences in our comms presuming time difference US to China. But they got the problem solved..and made me a happy owner confident that if any other issues arise on this - or any of their other products - that I will be supported. It appears that I am not alone in this opinion. Thanks to Soundcore.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
176,Rachel,"As a med student, I was so excited to get these headphones without investing a ton of money. I absolutely love the rose color, the case they come with and how easy they are to use. They're lightweight so they don't weigh down my backpack, but as a full headset they do take up a fair bit of room so keep that in mind if you're planning to travel or pack them out to work/school every day. My only complaint is the inequality in noise cancelling between the R and L earpiece. My left ear piece has perfect noise cancelling quality, but the R earpiece will only cancel noises if it is directly perpendicular with the noise source. This gets annoying when I turn my head between my computer and iPad, and when I unconsciously cock my head to one side as I write. Overall, it's a great product and I still would buy them again for a first time set of noise cancelling headphones. I have always been aware that I'm really noise sensitive, and these headphones have really highlighted that since I bought them because I get such a sense of relief from wearing them - even with the disparity in noise cancellation between the ear pieces. Overall, 7/10 - I really recommend them!",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Pink
177,Wordimont,"I've been using these regularly for about 11 months now. Here's my take.Pros:- Comfortable. I can wear them for hours without any issues.- Decent sound quality, but only if you take the time to tune the equalizer.- Decent noise cancellation.- Great battery life.Cons:- The microphone isn't good enough. People will probably understand you, but the quality falls short. I'm too embarrassed to use them in a meeting with this level of quality.- The audio quality is not great unless you take the time to tune the equalizer. This shouldn't be necessary.- The wear detection is worse than useless. The headphones will randomly stop playback when I'm wearing the headphones. And when I take them off, it won't stop. Worthless. I had to disable the feature.- The power button drives me crazy. You have to press it for a long time (5 seconds) to turn it on or off. And, if you accidentally turn it off (because you didn't realize they were already on, or because they timed out and turned themselves off automatically), you can't turn them back on right away. There's a delay before you can turn them back on again. It drives me crazy. To the designers: A one-second delay is plenty to protect against accidental bumps, and there should not be a delay before I can turn them back on again.- These turn off automatically way too soon. If I put them down for what seems like a short time, when I come back they're off again. And it's not always obvious they're off, so sometimes I accidentally turn them off rather than on, which is frustrating because of the long power button delay mentioned above. The battery life is so good on these that there's no reason for them to turn off so aggressively.- You can't use them while charging. Sometimes, the battery runs low or runs out while I'm using them. It'd be great if I could plug them in while I'm still using them. They just stop working once I plug in the power cord.It's really too bad because I think the power button and auto power feature would be super easy to fix with a firmware update. Or why not make it configurable?",2.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black

179,Tony H.,I have a lot of Anker products because they always work well. I use these exclusively for music and sometimes gaming.

I’ve tested it on a plane and with a large shop fan running a few feet away. It won’t cancel everything but nothing really does so that’s relative. It does dramatically reduce all external sounds from muddying the sound of what you’re trying to listen to. I wish volume and eq were better but I’m sure that’s why it’s priced like it is.

184,Sergeo,"I tried the Soundcore Q30, Q35, Sony 1000XM3 and Bose 700.Q30 & Q35 were the only ones that didn't have some kind of issue or problem complicating things immediately, and the Q30's were the only ones not instantly disappointing.Q35 seem to be Q30s with worse earpads, a little better ANC, a slightly more premium feel in general like the plastics, the carrying case and box it come in but much much worse transparency mode and an additional $50 price tag.I was primarily looking for the ones with the best transparency mode to be able to hear my kids and monitor the house at night while still listening to something privately.In the end the Bose 700 has the best transparency mode but too many other problem and extreme cost.The Bose 700 were the most disappointing.Literally had me saying outloud "" $400 for this, is this a joke"" as I struggled to get their terrible app to work with their headphones.The headphones linked to my phone as one device and thought the APP on the phone was a different device... I was literally googling Bose support pages with in 5 minutes of opening the very nice cardboard box to figure out how to reset the headphones device history  and re-pair them. Turned out to be easy to do but still infuriating, and took 3 tries before the APP managed the find the headphone anywhere near as quickly as the actual phone did and finally paired properly. The transparency mode is incredible but mostly I think because you can hear your own voice nearly perfectly so you don't have the 'inside a barrel"" feel. But also there was a faint repeating crackle or pop sound that was very tolerable if not for the pricepoint. the sheer cost amplifies the negative feeling associated with every little flaw and unfortunately these 700s have multiple. Bose transparency is the best but it is absolutely NOT $320 better than the Q30s.The Q30 had the second best transparency mode and the worst anc of them but still really good anc. (As in I could still fainly hear the air conditioner sitting 3 feet away from me).Sony's 1000xm3 had the best ANC but worse transparency mode than the Q30, with the xm3s you can hear everything but you can't tell what direction anything is coming from, it's odd. Like your not hearing your surroundings but instead are hearing a fake recreation of your surroundings being played back to you. It's hard to describe, I only realized that was the problem after hearing a bird outside, with the xm3s I could hear a bird but had no idea what direction it was coming from but with the Q30 I could hear the bird immediately and what direction it was.Note: with the xm3s, if you buy the international version all the voice prompts will be in Chinese.The sound is an awful bassy mess on all of them but the Bose 700s unless you fix them with the EQ but thankfully they all have a decent EQ with the exception of the Bose which has a nearly worthless EQ with 3 sliders. Ironically the worst EQ is on the one that doesn't need one basically at all but is so expensive you'd expect the option.Bose EQ is very clearly an afterthought slapped onto the app in response to Sony having one and being the new King of ANC.Oh also of note the Q30 and Q35 have that unpleasant ""new memory foam"" smell right out of the box but it nearly immediately goes away. Perhaps they should have let them air out for a few minutes before immediately shipping them. It's something you'll probably notice but shrug it off and you'll forget it was a thing at all.TLDR; Buy the Q30s and wonder to yourself what how they are 80% as good as Bose 700s at 20% of the cost.If the absolutely need the very best ANC money can buy get the xm4s probably but everyone else should buy Q30.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

When I'm at work they connect to my laptop, and I just keep using them for conference calls. They work great all the time. The noise canceling is very good and transparency mode is great when I'm walking city streets. When I ride the bus back home, I'm still using them for unwinding with a movie or some music. The comfort is so good that I can keep using them for long periods. I can hear traffic and people around me while listening to music. And I don't have to charge them for almost two days of heavy use.

197,Keith S.,Ok so let me start by saying this is the first pair of blue tooth over the ear headphones I’ve bought.Read quite a lot of reviews before ordering. So I’ll try not and repeat what others have said other than for the money I don’t know how these can be beat. I know they are not Sony or Bose but I honestly didn’t want to pay for those brands. I’m sure they are great. Out of the box I wasn’t impressed with the sound but and this to me is a big one. The app that controls these is amazing. For me I went with the acoustic preset and have found it worked great with the mixture of genres I listen to. It even allows for overriding all the settings to make it your own. I’ve had them on for about 4 hours and they are just getting slightly uncomfortable. I’ve used apple ear buds for a couple of years now and of course they don’t really compare to actual headphones.If you really want to hear the capability of these check out some audiophile videos and 8d stuff on YouTube.Got them for 109.00 after using a Amazon coupon at checkout. Like I said these are gonna be hard to beat at that price or even a little beyond. I know they have the LDAC feature but I can’t speak to that because I’m using them through the iPhone and iPad. Overall I can’t see how you can go wrong with these.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black

All of a sudden the volume in the headphones on each side is very different. One is noticeably louder than the other. I’ve never listened louder than like 3/4 volume for any extended period of time, usually 1/2.

Some of my clients talk really soft and I actual was able to hear them. L last week, I wrote these almost every day, all day due to meetings. They are very comfortable. They don't make me sweat around the ears, which is nice. I definitely recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
202,LincolnRider,"My initial impressions:  Comfortable and light weight.  Love the transparent feature and decent noise canceling.What I wish could be better:  the equalizer in the app is pretty limited, from 100Hz to 12KHz bands and only up to 6 db adjustment.  Would really like to see a wider equalizer, at the very least, 60Hz to 16KHz for finer control.Also, the vinyl cups can be overwhelmingly smelly as they are still curing from the manufacturing process.  These kind of smells could take a little while to disappear.update July 12 2021:  One thing I've noticed between the three modes (Noise Canceling, Transparency, Normal) is that in Transparency and Normal modes, the bass is drastically reduced.  I'm not sure why they designed it to do that but I love listening to music with low bass notes, so this is a little disappointing when I want to use Transparency mode.  However, in NC mode, the bass is amazing and really gets down on those bass notes when you have the source EQ set right.Advice on setting your EQ if you are on a Samsung phone:To get even more deeper bass and crispier highs, go into the Android Sound settings and look for the equalizer.  Instead of ""pumping up"" any of the EQ bars, bring DOWN the bars  instead.  This causes the the frequencies beyond the very ends to stay at near zero attenuation even if you don't see it on screen.  You'll hear the difference.  The android EQ is a little strange.Update January 2022:I continue enjoying the headphones.  My only real beef with them at this point is the cheap noisy plastic, especially in a quiet room.  I've woken up my significant other a few times in bed when I removed the headphones from my head to put them away.  Any kind of flexing and they can wake up the dead.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

204,Jez,"These things are GREAT, and I love them.  They do a pretty good job of noise cancellation (I use them primarily for drowning out noise in an open office environment), and the sound is awesome.  Finally some headphones that get loud!  The app is neat, but I do wish I could control the headphones with the app when it's connected to my work laptop for meetings.  I love the fast switching; they seem to pair with *everything* and it's super convenient to start a meeting without having to connect/disconnect.  I haven't used the transparency tap yet, but I can also say that the take off/pause and put on/play works great, and I love that.  I take them off to answer a question of a co-worker and don't miss but a few words of my podcast or audiobook.  Overall, these are great, super comfortable to wear for 8 hours or so a day, hold a great charge, and are very attractive.  I got the pink, and the color is subtle and soft, not jarring.  Soundcore/Anker makes great stuff, and I have a house full of their speakers, cables, and even bought their Eufy security system.

I can see these phones being very acceptable for a lot of people.

207,McGuy,"First my bias.  I am a fan of Anker.  It is one Chinese company that builds quality innovative electrics at a very competitive price. This headset has great sound.  It can sound as good as the Bose for music, but with the added benefit of being able to adjust the sound better for different types of listening.  E.g., Bose has too much bass for speech, which is 90% of what I listen to.  The Anker Life Q35, can deliver the strong mellow bass sound of a Bose that I like for music, but it can be easily tuned to deliver clear speech, also.  Battery life is excellent.  I've never run out of power in any single day of use.  I charge overnight.  Aesthetics are good, IMO.  Materials and build quality seem good so far, only time will tell how durable any product is.  The firmware still needs some tweaking.  One firmware upgrade improved some of the issues I was experiencing.  Still, re-connecting to a device can be hit-and-miss.  It still occasionally disconnects for no apparently reason.  The on/off button takes a 4-5 second press to activate, why?  It won't connect to my Sony TV (It may be more of problem with the TV than the headset, who knows).  The headband needs a pad to help hold it in place.  Nevertheless, overall it a very good product, well worth the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
208,TIFFANY S. HUERD,"When I first purchased this headphone set I was really looking for something to help me sleep.  I had just moved into a small condo/roommate situation which was in a busier area with lots of outside noise that I was not acustomed to.  When I first put them on and turned on the noise canceling mode for outdoor noise, I was blown away!  It's like I was on another planet.  Just me and whatever I wanted to stream through the headphones.  I love that the app has various white noise options to help me sleep and my phone calls through this product have been so clear!Above all though, I was blown away with the level of customer service and dedication this company puts forth on a daily basis.  After a few weeks I had a little issue with the set I first purchased, I reached out to Ankler and once they found out what was going on they immedicately got me set up with a new set and let me know that what I was experiencing isn't normal but that their engineers wanted to find out why it happened on that pair.  My second pair arrived within days with no issues and with all the same high-level of noise cancelling that I was loooking for.  I highly recommend one of the Ankler products if you have never tried.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Pink

These are just right tight enough to fit securely and and get a good seal around the ear. These work well with my iPhone, iPad and pc. The iPhone and iPad seem to work better as they stay paired but my pc needs to be repaired almost daily even if it was the last thing I used the headphones with, I think it may be Windows and not the headphones. The sound quality is very good for the price of the headphones and the battery life is great. I can use them all day long at work and they are still going strong, I have forgotten to charge them overnight and they will go a second day as well. The noise cancelation is very good as well, and can be switch to transparence mode to let some sound in when you need that.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

212,Adrian Potts,"So, my story with these headphones is very detailed but I'll try to keep it brief. I originally came here to buy the q30 again because I gave my original pair away when I saw the Q35 for sale. I purchased those and immediately had problems. The wear sensor detection was wonky and I was experiencing LDAC sound quality issues. SoundCore sent me a replacement pair and it was the same issues. I reached out to their customer service and they sent me an LDAC from where update 1.18 and that fixed it. With that said... These headsets are the best on the market with the LDAC. The music really comes alive. At its loudest it sounds like you're at a concert. If you are someone likes to customize your sound you are going to get the most out of these headphones. Even if you don't want to customize you have 22 different presets that are excellent My personal favorite is acoustic and piano. I will admit that the sound core signature is a little low and the bass is pretty heavy but with that being said you have so many other choices That's not even relevant in my opinion. They fit very well. I love the color and the matte finish. They look so much more like premium headphones. I can't give these five stars because while the microphones are better on these than the q30 they still have some ways to go. But in a controlled choir environment they work just fine. I just happened to use them in in a lot of environments and so they're not as good and louder environments. Also they have to fix the wear sensor detection which was one of their main selling points to justify an extra $50. But I have all the confidence in the world that they have a firmware update for that as well. If you're looking to get your update now just contact soundcores customer service and they should help you like they did me. Thanks SoundCore!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

215,JB,"I had a pair of Q20 for about a year. I like them a lot, the price was great for ANC wireless headphones. The issue was the microphone, it wasn't very good when using Zoom/Teams/Webex etc. I upgraded to the Q35 because it has a better mic array. The sound quality of the Q35 is very very good and the mic is better...BUT the ANC is not nearly as good as the Q20 for whatever reason. My office has a large HVAC vent above me that is constantly blowing 24/7 365. The Q20 cut it out almost completely, the Q35 I can still hear it too much. I tried changing the ANC profile in the app and it honestly seems to do absolutely nothing. I may have to return the Q35 and go back to the Q20.  If you don't need really good ANC, the Q35 had superior audio quality. But the Q20 definitely has much better ANC.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

222,Aronai,"These have surprisingly good ANC. When I compare them to my Sony WHXB900N, the ANC on these is actually quite a bit better, despite Sony being known for pretty good ANC. The ANC is not as good as an oldish Bose QC35II I have though. In the grand scheme of things, I'd rate the ANC at 8/10. Better than most other brands I've tried, held up well on my most recent flight.The comfort could use some work, though. The earpads are a little more stiff than competitors, owing to whatever foam they used I guess. The similarly priced WHXB900N are more comfortable, to me.The Anker app is good. Allows customizations that I want, and is far better than most of the other brands' apps for customizing headphones.A large complaint of mine comes from them attempting to copy the 'hold hand over earcup for quick attention mode transparency' thing from other brands. They did a poor job here, though one they could probably fix with a firmware update. If I do this gesture on my Sonys, the transparency mode comes on instantly basically as soon as my hand touches the earcup. On these, there's something like a 2 second delay, and a beep, and then transparency turns on. I feel like I'd have to tell whoever's trying to talk to me to just stand there and wait for a second while I wait for my headphones to catch up.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

Either that or I'm expecting too much from ANC on full size headphones (my first wireless full size).Otherwise, fantastic, flexible sound quality. Don't quite understand when they're dinged here. Unlike the static tuning of wired headphones, you aren't stuck with the default sound. You can adjust them however YOU want in the app, then shut it down or even uninstall it - that 8 band EQ setting is stored in the headset. Then I pair to my Windows PC and fine tune EQ various media from there. This was my main purpose buying them and for that, very happy.

227,TBolt,So I started looking at headphones in November. My two main goals were comfort and noise canceling. The sound just needed to be decent. So first up on what I thought was a great Black Friday deal was Skullcandy Hesh ANC. They were good at noise canceling but terrible on comfort. Then came Treblab Z2. No noise canceling to speak of!  So to tell the truth I was getting a little frustrated. I decided one more try plus I would spend a little more. So now comes the Q35s that I got on sale. Wow! Comfort and ANC are great!! The sound is fantastic! Battery life is unbelievable and the build on these things is solid. How smooth the head adjustment is and no plastic creaking noise. Hesh phones creaked and weren't easy to adjust. I really can't say anything bad about the Q35s. I am not picky about my sound but when I discovered that my LDAC really wasn't on even though I had gone into settings and made sure it was on there. I found out under bluetooth devices I also had to turn on there. Well it was unbelievable how much better these sounded then! I already thought they were great! Now much better!

The audio quality still impresses me every day, they sound very nice compared to the flat noise I've been accustomed to. MONEY WELL SPENT!Here are the problems with the headphones, though:1. Computer compatibility. For some unknown reason, I occasionally get ANC crackling when using these on my computer, I've never had this issue on my phone. I've yet to pinpoint why this happens, I think this might be an incompatibility with my computer's audio drivers.2. Comfort. They feel fairly heavy and tight compared to cheaper headphones I've owned, they're not inherently uncomfortable, but after wearing these all day (as a productive member of society should), these can be cumbersome.Old Review:The multipoint connection is awesome.

I was beyond excited to get the Anker Sound Core Life Q35 headphones. Unfortunately, whenever I used them, they would constantly disconnect from my devices. Every time this happened, I checked everything to make sure everything was set up as to ensure this would not happen again. Instead, this issue would occur over and over. I'm extremely disappointed about this. Anker made a name for itself because in the past, they made quality reliable products. For some reason, the last year every Anker product I've purchased, they would always break, or some other issue would occur. I also purchased in the last year the Anker Charging Stand for iPhone, Watch, and my Apple AirPods Pro. Sure enough after a year of using this Anker product, the product no longer works.

242,Gnurflegnarfer,"I know there are a mix of good and bad reviews out there and I have read them all. I'll start with the pros overall excellent sound quality very crisp and clear. The noise-cancelling is phenomenal, with multiple modes including a transparency mode so you can hear what's going on around you through the little microphones. The battery life is amazing it lasted for weeks using it multiple hours per day on the factory charge out of the box. It charged relatively quickly too full and I've been using it for a few weeks now regularly oh, and it is only down to about 60% battery life. The headphones are extremely comfortable to wear I haven't noticed any issues with them being too tight or even too hot like many others have said they're actually quite cool.The only con I found in common with other people is the change in sound profile when toggling between normal mode and noise cancelling. There is a significant increase in base in normal mode vs in noise-canceling but I have experience that with other headphones at higher price points so I don't know why people are complaining so intently about this particular quirk. I will say that the app allows for very easy correction of this issue as you can store multiple custom EQ presets tailored to your liking. You simply save a preset that compensates for the bass increase in normal mode and switch to that when you turn off the ANC. For headphones under the $200 price point these are extremely impressive.

The Soundcore app is amazing, with the ability to tailor noise cancelling settings depending on your surroundings (transport, indoor, and outdoor modes) and equalizer settings to maximize the quality of what you’re listening to (e.g., rock, electronic, acoustic, bass boosting, treble boosting…), plus a large library of white noise sounds (think: thunderstorms, fire crackling, cooking sounds, typing/office sounds, cats purring…) that you can customize into your own mix. I loved the Q20, but these headphones far exceeded my expectations and are incredible value for the price. Buy buy buy!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black

245,Jonathan,"Simply awesome wireless noise cancelling headphones for their price.  I previously ordered the Sony WH-1000MX4 which cost nearly triple these.  While the Sony's had better noise cancelling ability, they sounded about the same to me, and the Sony's simply weren't worth the cost in my opinion.  I am very satisfied with the Q35s.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
246,Stephen Dale Spicer,"Update:After some research, I found that I can reset the headset to factory defaults, so I though that I'd give that a try, after the factory reset the headset works as expected, the sounds not bad for a wireless headset,Not sure I care for the On/Off chime (seems to be the same), and should just say On or Off.Anyway, No more disconnect or Popping for now, but cannot recommend for a buy until I've used them awhile and the problems I've had don't reoccur.I purchased the headset because using earbuds don't block out any outside noise while mowing the yard, the headphones are better in that respect but not great.Just received my Q35 headset today, made sure it had a full charge before trying them out, Paired the headset to my Sony NW-A55 Walkman MP3 Player, the music sounds Ok, but the headset kept dropping the signal, popping then picking the signal back up;so, I tried pairing the headset to my computer, the same issue, the signal/music would drop then pop and pick the signal back up.I have a set of Bluetooth earbuds that works perfectly, I just wanted a headset to help cut out some outside noise, almost purchased a less expansive headset, guess I'll get them ordered.Unless I received a defective pair, I cannot recommend this product.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
247,clay282,"I guess I don't fit the main demographic of headphone users. I have some older wireless earbuds for when I'm out, they have served me well for a long time and I easily stuff them in the trucks center console. I like full over the ear headphones when I'm at home and listen to music Bluetooth streamed from my PC, Laptop, or TV, whichever one I'm using at the moment. I think this is the problem.I picked up a pair of over the ear headphones from Amazon a year or 2 back called Tribit. Very affordable and were prolly $40 at the time. The sounds always been good, but then someone turned me onto the Dolby Access app that works with Bluetooth headphones. Game changer! The cheap headphones suddenly got crisper, clearer and thumped hard enough at full volume, they would hurt by ears.This year I decided to treat myself to some more expensive headphones and ALMOST picked up the fancy Sony's when Amazon had them $100 off for Black Friday. Then after seeing reviews, these Life Q35's seemed to hold their own and, in some cases, reviewers rated them higher than the Mack Daddy Sony's. Decided to buy them and from all reviews, was really excited. I just got them in today and was TRULY expecting to be blown away... I am not.I think the problem is, no Windows 11 app. Anker Life Q35's have an iPhone app, but nothing for PC. On my phone, I can tweak and bend the sound, but not to any point that sounds better than the cheap Tribit's with a $10 Dolby Access app for Windows.These Life Q34's do have the bells and whistles, but I can't justify it. Active Noise Cancellation isn't something I need since I'm at home when I use the big headphones.It's nice to simply take off the headphones to pause and resume BUT, if I'm taking them on and off and have them in hand, I can just bump the power button and these pause and play.When connected to my Laptop with no Life Q35 app AND no Dolby Access app running, the Life Q35's do sound better, but not immensely. Not $80 better, not even $10 better. So, I come back to an app and for PC, that's Dolby Access because Anker Life Q35 doesn't offer one for PC. When I use that, which is the PC equivalent to the Life Q35 app... they lose and they lose badly. Bass heavy and muddy in the middle. I'm no audiophile by any means, but it's clearly a difference that's NOT in favor of the Q35's.These headphones really make me think about hardware versus software. How can an older set of cheaper headphones sound as good? If you need the NFC connecting, ANC system, fast charging, don't have the dexterity to bump a button for pause and play and exclusively use your cellphone for music, these would make excellent headphones for you. As for me, I will be returning them. I don't need the added features and there isn't $140 (tax included) worth of sound or product for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
248,Mark Albrecht,"Awesome noice cancelation, comfortable sound quality is great. Great for planes, trains, busses etc. Only complaint is they come loose at the gym and while running.

I wasn't expecting much, so I was blown away at the audio sound stage created by these headphones. I still shake my head when I listen to music.  Amazing.  So full and rich.  I've used Audi Technica, Beyerdynamic, Sony, Grado, etc over the years.  These headphones seriously challenge those brands.  No kidding.  Plus, the noise cancelling is about 90% of the XM3s and it NEVER disconnects.  It also pairs up with my iPhone and personal computer at the same time and automatically switches between them through the Soundcore app on my iPhone.  Everything works...good.  So painless to use.

Also noticed on certain occasions  I would hear , a scratchy sounds as if it’s picking up frequency interference, while using blue tooth. I thought this would have lasted me for at least 5 years . I Can’t give an honest review on the sound quality (music wise), since I mainly uses it for, video streaming and podcasting, and it serves me well , in those Genres.

253,Parker Snell,"These sound so good. They're bluetooth and wired so I can use them wireless when walking around and then plug them in when playing or producing music. The battery seems to last forever although tbh I don't keep them on all the time. They have both noise canceling and ""transparency"" mode which is super cool, it's an ambient noise pass-through so it looks like you can't hear people but you secretly can, like a spy.Theres like a million buttons (ok actually 5) on the headphones themselves so you don't really need to even pull your phone out. This is the one thing I'd probably change - when the headphone volume is max and you press + again, it interrupts whatever's playing for a long seeming time. I don't think this is necessary and it could just do nothing at that point like my phone does. It'd also be cool if these buttons controlled my phone volume instead of a separate setting. However this is a very minor complaint compared to how cool these are.There is an app you can download to change some of the settings, most of all EQ that can't be done with just the buttons on the headphones.Ok lastly they also come with an airplane type two headphone plug adapter. Have you ever had headphones just include this? Is this a thing? Because when I saw that I thought wow, they really thought of everything!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

255,Ernest B,"My VERY expensive Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones lasted exactly 11 months, then I was attacked in both ears by VERY loud squealing/screeching noises, and I mean PIERCING!  After several days of arcane procedures to convince Sony that I was not a crook, they started working again just as I was ready to send in my Proof of Purchase forms and get a replacement set. Okay,  so problem solved...NOPE. IT CAME BACK two weeks later and even louder. Rather than ending up deaf, in a fit of disgust, I dismantled them with a hammer and sent them to the local landfill. I was not ready to go through that again. By comparison, these Q-35s are far superior in all areas...and they were a LOT cheaper! Sure I am out a wad of cash, but all in all, in the long run, it was worth it. These are superior in every way, plus they come with several improvements that the Sony earphones did NOT have.

258,Courtney,I purchased these solely for use when traveling and on airplanes. The only thing that really matters to me is the noise cancellation and it was below par. It was helpful with the fuzzy/turbulent airplane noises but that was it. I did not help with other sounds or voices at all. I actually tried to ask someone a few rows away to speak more softly because I could still hear them clearly with the volume up and noise cancelling on.I also purchased Beats Studio3s and the Anker Soundcore Q30s. Each of the three models were marginally better than the last (as the price went up) but none were worth keeping.I recently used my husband’s Sony headphones and I’ve finally accepted that only Sony or Bose will have good noise cancellation and nothing under $300 is going to really very well for what I am looking for.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

I returned them and chose a different pair.I own the Soundcore Motion + Bluetooth speaker and it's one of the best purchases I've ever made. This is why I gave these headphones a try.The good :- The sound quality is good enough- The Noise cancelling was good enough to kill an industrial metal fan sitting right next to me.- The battery life is ridiculous. They came with a 50% charge out of the box. I charged them once to 100% and never got them back under 70% for the rest of the time I had them.- You get so many features for the money. Bluetooth + wired operation, ANC, LDAC, easy controls, a great app- They look fantasticThe bad :- The volume level is annoyingly low, especially in Bluetooth mode. Both phone and MacBook Air required nearly 100% volume for a normal experience. Anything 50% and below volume level is unusable. I tried every trick in the book.- Even with a fully collapsed head band, I still couldn't get a firm fit on my head. Maybe my head is incredibly small.-The padding that sits on top of your head is way too weak and soft for the job it's supposed to do.

Yes.They made all the music I have listened to for YEARS sound NEW again.Download the Soundcore app, set the Q35's to ""Acoustic"" in the Equalizer and enjoy.My music was SO crisp. I ended up spending like the next 4 hoirs just rolling through my old music listening to how epic everything sounded. I listened to an old RUSH concert from 81 and just couldn't stop repeating songs listening to the BACKGROUND noises, and how DEFINED everything Geddy did was. I was like WHAT IS THIS SOURCERY.Definitely a fan of these now. I have put off buying a pair of Ankers but the noise canceling for the PRICE is fantastic. The sound quality is superb. The quality of the build feels very good. They can be tossed on the bed/couch and won't explode.If you're thinking about it, and if they're in your budget. Do it. You will NOT be disappointed. PLAY WITH THE EQ and find YOUR favorite sound! Also make SURE YOU ARE USING LDAC or it will use STANDARD bluetooth. My phone TELLS ME it is using the LDAC BT.

You're gonna love them.Update: June 5th 2022So I haven't used my headphones in about two weeks and when I picked them up I noticed that the cup was completely busted open. Pretty disappointed that they're doing the same thing as some cheaper brands. I thought I had solved this by getting these but I was wrong. I do NOT abuse them. They don't leave my house and I don't abuse my things. So the fact that they're falling apart before a year really says something. Do they still sound good? YES.

262,Joshua,"Got these after trying a less expensive option and being disappointed.  These were to replace a pair of headphones I had been using for years and that I loved but had just started to wear out.  These headphones can be worn for hours with no discomfort.  They came with a case, that I rarely use but it's still a nice thing to have with them.  I like the noise cancellation even though you can still hear some background sounds you can definitely tell it is on.  Also, the transparent mode is both easily accessed and very helpful when you need to pause to listen to someone or something.  I do wish the transparent mode made outside sounds a little louder though.  As far as sound quality overall... These are not studio headphones for those audiophiles out there that are looking for every nuance of sound.

As well, the Q35s disconnect from my phone during calls and when listening to audio. These issues seem to occur more often when the headphones aren’t fully charged.I will next experiment by turning off the auto-stop feature that kicks in when you remove the headphones, but this still wouldn’t explain the mic issues, and possibly not the disconnecting headphones during a call.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Pink
265,Anonymous Shopper,"I bought these headphones on a whim because they were the Amazon deal of the day.  Only in the last couple of years did I adopt wireless tech, having been my whole adult life a big advocate for wired headphones and ear buds.  However, I feel technology has finally caught up to satisfy mid-level audiophiles such as myself.  For 100 dollars, these headphones deliver.  I use them mostly for music listening while doing chores, but recently used them on multiple cross-country flights and they worked splendidly.  My one complaint is there is no holistic solution for noise cancelation.  Anker likes to give you multiple options to block out specific ranges of sound.  I would like it if they'd just give an option to block out everything.  But sound quality is excellent especially for the price, battery life is phenomenal, comfort level is unbelievable (I wear them for hours with no discomfort), they get plenty loud if that's a concern of yours, and they sound great for all assortments of music.  I noticed other reviewers commenting on there being too much bass.  Well I guess a flaw to others is a feature to me because I'm a huge bass head and I love it.  Highly recommended.  Anker knocked it out the park with these.  I can't comment on how they sound wired as I haven't tried it yet, but that's a nice touch for us old school wired audio fans.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

267,adrien,"Decent overall sound for the price point (7/10). The equalizer in the soundcore app isn't too bad but has room for improvement. I just stuck with the acoustic option as opposed to the recommended default setting.Noise cancelling is really underwhelming compared to the Sony xm4 and galaxybuds2 that I tried out recently. I'd give the noise cancelling on these a 4/10 whereas I'd give the Sony xm4 an 8/10 and galaxybuds2 a 6.5/10.The auto pause/play when headphones removed feature needs work and tends to be more of a nuisance for me when activated since it lags for about 3-5 secs sometimes when headphones are removed. Also the headphones would randomly stop my music when I have them on, I'm assuming that my movement (doesn't take much) triggered the autopause.The microphone quality is really bad 4/10. After speaking with 3 different people they've all wanted to know why I was sounding like I was in a can. I confirmed the issue myself as well. Resetting the headphones, re-pairing Bluetooth, reinstalling app, restarting phone and headphones etc did not help improve mic quality.The headphones also have a high amount of sound leak as well. So they won't be good for discrete listening. People could clearly hear the lyrics and instrumentals of the music I was listening to at about 80% volume from at least 6 ft away in a quiet room.I will be returning these but will recommend for those who don't need headphones for calls but want decent sound quality, good battery life and easy to use controls at a decent price point.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

I have had very good experience on other anker products in the past and this was my only low point. Anyway thanks Anker, good job on customer service.Original review:Battery life was excellent, way better than competition. Music is base heavy like many modern headphones.

I had expected to use them while cutting my lawn on a lawn tractor while listing to music however they don't cancel out enough noise to do that while listening to the music at a reasonable volume.The only other problem that I have is in finding the buttons to change volume and to change modes while wearing them. The buttons are very small and smooth so they are hard to locate by touch however, the more I wear them, the easier it is for me. I guess it just takes more familiarity. That is why I rated them a 4. I gave the battery life a 5 not really knowing how long they will stay charged. I only wear them for 1 1/2 hours at a time at most and recharge them often even though they don't tell me that the battery is low.

Frustrated that LDAC is unusable and I have to disable HD audio just to play music without pops every 11 seconds. Frustrated that the sound quality is beyond terrible without ANC turned on all the time. Build quality seems poor on the earcups, don't think they'll hold up long term. On/off detection frequently causes the music to pause, so I disabled it.But ANC is quite good, sound quality is good (as long as you leave ANC on and disable LDAC), comfort is good, battery life is good, transparency mode is good. They can probably fix most of the issues with a firmware update. If they update my firmware I'll update this review.Edit: Anker support reached out and now I have version 1.18 firmware on the headphones . . . still checking out how it sounds and connects (much better so far), but I'll raise from 2 to 3 stars at this point, for customer service that is on the ball.Edit: outstanding customer service by Anker, they shipped me another pair that seems to work a little better.

Noise Cancellation -  I don't have the best experience with this, so I don't know how good this is. But it's okay for me.3. Multipoint - I love multipoint connection. I hate having to reconnect my laptop, tv and phone everytime I would like to switch. This has been really fun to use.3. Sound - Wow!!! Admittedly the Soundcore Default Signature sound is not good. It's honestly trash. But once you get to play around with the app and set your custom signature, this baby rocks. Seriously. Then couple that with Dolby Atmos and LDAC. This pair is sick.CONS ish!1. I heard some reviews about the left channel being louder than the right. I have zero experience with this so far. I guess some guys were unlucky with their pairs.2.

Sometimes shutting off the unit fixes the problem, but usually not. No matter what I try (even support articles about the issue), the crackling just comes back when using noise cancellation - especially if I don't have any audio playing.- Switching between 2 connected devices does not work well, and it seems to randomly give priority to connected devices.- The Android app is useless, and may as well not exist. You can't even manage connected devices.Maybe these are firmware issues that can be rectified with an update? I don't know. The headphone itself is comfortable and the sounds quality (when not crackling) is good. The audio quality for meetings is also good.

285,Otniel C.,"The Features are an improvement over the life q30, the mic quality is better, the on/off detection works really well and the addition of LDAC codec is a nice touch. But that’s as far it goes when it comes to pros over the life q30. If your a bass head you’re going to love this headphone it has a lot of bass out of the box(way to much in my opinion) Even with eq you can’t get rid of the boosted sub bass and mid bass making it bleed into the other frequencies. Is fair to mention that the eq makes this a better sounding headphone, but not better than the life q30. The life q 30 are “bassy” out of the box as well, but not as much as the life q35. The comfort, the life q35 have different pads they feel more high quality when it comes to the memory foam, but for some reason in my case my ears start going hotter quicker and that boosted sub bass rattles my head to no end making this headphone not very comfortable for long listening sections. The ANC is the same as the life q30 so no improvement there to my ears. So in conclusion if you like detail and more clarity on your mids and highs go for the cheaper option(with eq) if you like bass and the extra features go with the life q35. Hope this helps!",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

291,MeTaLhEaD,"The good:-These sounded pretty great once you create a flat profile.-They were overwhelmingly bass heavy initially.-Once tweaked, the sound quality was great when setting this up through my PC or android phone.-Build quality was spot on. The padding is great on the top and the headphones padding feels comfortable if you have small ears.The Bad:-The fit is too tight. I'd consider my ears average size, but the tips of my ears hit the inside of the cans making these hurt after about an hour.-Heavy, these cans weigh a lot more then previous wireless headphones.-Transparency mode annoying. I kept activating it on accident since any little press towards the right headphone turns it on or off.-Mic quality. The mic had a max bitrate of 16khz at one channel. I haven't seen number that low since the 90s! It is 2022, there is no reason for a microphone to have a bitrate that low for making a call or voice chatting.-Not Full Duplex. As soon as the mic gets activated on PC or Android, the headphones quality dips to 16k mono. The headphones support 48k, yet as soon as someone calls OR the mic gets activated by settings or software, the audio drops to ""Tape Quality"".The reason I returned:Stay away from these if you plan on utilizing voice chat or the microphone feature in any way. They are basically useless for voice chat or phone calls while still listening to music. (discord)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
292,Dusty Hats,"I bought these to replace an uncomfortable and lackluster pair of wired ""gaming"" headphones from a company I had high respect for. Comparatively speaking, audio quality is amazing for music and light/mmo gaming. I don't play FPS, so I can't comment on that. I didn't notice any audio lag from my PC, even when dual-paired between my phone and PC. There was a bit of audio lag when playing a mobile game, but switching from LDAC to AAC in the Bluetooth settings cleared that up. App has amazing EQ customization and the LDAC takes advantage of it. I'm still working through the break-in period, so I can only expect them to get better. ANC is nice, but I feel like the Life Pro 2 earbuds do it better. Definitely not to the level of a good/expensive set of Sony or Bose, but you get what you pay for. It will be sufficient for home-office working (I can't hear fans/PC/dog with ANC on and music playing) or traveling.A really neat feature is the customizable white-noise system in the app. I had it set to sound like a stormy night at the beach. Had some good memories come back. :)So far, for the price, these are excellent Bluetooth cans. I'm very satisfied and happy with them.That being said, if you're not concerned with having LDAC or a few other features, the Life Q30 is almost half the price. Definitely compare the two. Personally, I felt the features justified the price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

294,TomR,"Great sound, love the presets, great battery life, but two caveats…1. Whatever LDAC does (I’m no audiophile), it doesn’t do it on an iPhone or iPad. Apple does not support the LDAC codec. LDAC is one of the advertised upgrade benefits of the Q35 over the Q30. This was never mentioned in any Anker ad copy that I saw. Only one online reviewer mentioned it in passing. Sorry Apple fans.2. The auto-pause “feature” is flaky. It would unceremoniously freeze my videos and audios with no provocation whatsoever. After 2 returns to Anker (great customer service BTW) I finally found how to disable it in the Soundcore app: turn on your Q35s and make sure they are paired to your mobile device. Wait for the app to “discover” your Q35s. Then tap the Settings gear icon upper right. Move the “Wearing Detection” slider to the left to disable this “feature”. After I did this, the headphones are rock solid. It took me way longer to figure this out than it should have.Despite the issues above these are excellent headphones, I’m keeping mine.

Initially had problems using them as bluetooth headset for computer calls so I switched to a wired setup and that seems to working well. Haven't had a chance to use them for travel but the little that I have experimented with ANC, it seems it will do the job. The bad - they are heavy for wearing long term use and I don't know how that will impact the intended use for travel. And I have a large noggin - which means they are tight and it's a relief taking them off, especially after a 2 hour call. Hopefully, they'll loosen up after some time. So, again, don't know how I'll fare with them for a long flight.

I have a Samsung TV so all I did was go to settings - select sound - Bluetooth speaker - press my head phones power button until the light started blinking - then my headphone set popped up on my tv - I selected the headphones and bam - I was able to watch my show in peace!!!!

305,BG,"Headphones sounded great for me- but only when NC was turned on.This was the only time that the audio stage felt centered, whenever I tried listening using the other modes the audio had a clear imbalance favoring the left ear piece. This resulted in a sense of fullness to just that ear. I’m still not entirely sure what was going on.I checked for any available firmware updates at this time.My suspicion is that the unit had a software error and was possibly always partially running noise cancellation to just one side. I compared them directly against other headsets on the same audio tracks (Sony wireless, Sony wired, AirPods, and others) on both phone and pc to verify that it wasn’t the audio track mixing.I’m the end I think these headphones offer a lot of quality for the price (up to you to decide if the price over q20 is warranted), with an excellent fit and finish.

I bought these because I really liked the soundcore 30's (a step down.) so Obviously I thought paying a little more would get me a better product. not the case. Here are the issues.1. Sometimes my phone or computer volunteer buttons won't control the headphones. I have to manually use the volume buttons on the headphones which is super annoying. There is no explanation why this happens. I've checked the manual, looked up online. nothing. This happened with both pairs2. Very often my music or a show im watching will just pause for no reason while I have the headphones on. ITS SO ANNOYING. I have to continually unpause my music or the show because I guess the way it's built the physical pause button is super sensitive and randomly does this. This also happens daily on both pairs of headphones.One pair sometimes there is very loud static that plays in the right ear. only way to fix it is to turn it off and back on.All these issues began within the first 3 months. Buyer be ware. The only issue I had with the soundcore 30s was that the ear piece skin came loose and the foam on the inside was exposed and falling out. those cost like 80. ugh.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
310,Stacy A.,"These Soundcore Life Q35 headphones give you the Best All-round Quality and Value for your money than any other Wireless Headphones in or even above their price range!!!  The Soundcore App is Amazing!!! It has numerous preset sound choices for you to choose from & even custom equalizer.  You can control ANC and Ambient sound.  You can manage about anything you can think of in the App.  These headphones have supurb sound quality, no matter what genre of music you listen to, with punchy bass, clear mids, and sparkling hi's. And remember you can adjust the sound any way you like on the App. There are FULL controls on the headphones for volume, change track, adjust ANC/Ambient noise, etc.  Microphones work well, voice sounds clear & loud so phone calls no problem. I don't know what else to say except I was pleasantly surprised at just how good these Q35's are.  You do not have to spend $300+ to get great sounding headphones with ANC anymore, not unless you are a true audiophile and willing & have the money to spend $300 -$600+, that is not the average consumer.

I looked on youtube and it looks like other people have the same problem. How can you have a product that notoriously doesn't charge? So weird and frustrating.EDIT: I contacted Soundcore, sent in my defective headphones and received new ones the STILL DO NOT CHARGE. Also, I am a relatively technologically competent person this is a manufacturing issue. I have tried multiple outlets, multiple USB wall connectors and the red charging light goes on for 10 seconds and then disappears and no matter how long I plug in the headphones, there is never a full charge.

So naturally I compared these to those.  Headphones were 1/2 the price and the sound is ok.  It’s really nice how long the battery lasts on the headphones and they are more comfortable for long time wear.  The headphones are barely noise canceling, so don’t buy them if that is your primary need.  But the thing that really drives me crazy is the feature that is supposed to turn the headphones off if removed.  You can hold them off your head and they don’t stop playing but heaven forbid you look down to do something and they stop.  I hit play, they play 1 sec, and stop again!  And this continues over & over until you don’t look down (hard to do if you’re say, cooking dinner)!  I saw somewhere the only way to turn off this feature is if you control them with their app.  I need another app like I need a hole in the head.  They seem to be worse about it the lower the battery gets.

I currently have the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro's which are FANTASTIC, but just don't quite cancel out as much noise as I would like while on a plane. Since every other soundcore product I have ever had was amazing, I knew the life Q35 was the one I wanted without even trying other brands.Unfortunately, they didn't quite meet the mark for me.-The fit was off because the form factor on them is just a little bit too small. (My dad said I look like princess Leia... lol)-I didn't really like the color of them. (Which I thought I would from the pictures... it was lighter than I thought.)- The biggest problem that I had with them though, was that the noise cancelling was NOT better than my liberty air 2 pro headphones which are only earbuds. Kudos to the air 2 pro's for being so great, but the Q35's were not better, and in fact were worse.- I didn't have them long enough to try the battery life.- Sound quality was ok, but I had some muddiness, and static type sounds when I had Noise Cancelling on.Over all, I would have to say they are better than nothing, but the Q35, missed the mark for what I was wanting.Don't let this review steer you away from other soundcore headphones!!

I tried resetting it, and it fixes the problem temporarily3) the wear detection can be a little weird sometimes; if I tilt my head a certain way or lay back with the headphones on, the music will stop as if I've taken the headphones off.The sound quality is actually really good, which is why I wanted to give these headphones the benefit of the doubt.

Given that I have to switch the audio source;Second, the ringer on the head set is so low and must default to the lowest setting.  Half the time I can not even hear it ring.  This despite the phone being on the highest ringer volume;Third, these are just noisy.  I know these are budget but at $130, they aren't really too budget.  They make a lot of noise when I move around, like plastic rubbing against plastic. I don't know if it is just my pair, but it is just odd;Fourth, the operating buttons feel very cheap and flimsy.  Mine feel like they can fall out at any time;Fifth, the wearing detection is rather lack luster.

I am on a PC and these headsets are made for non-Apple products (while they work just fine with Apple).  The sound on the computer music and zoom, video calls is mind-blowing!

My Plantronics will last for a weeks if I'm not using them even if they're turned onn (they go into standby mode). These die after a couple of days.- The dual device functionality is very glitchy. I had them connected to 2 PCs and while watching videos they will randomly switch control to the other PC that's doing nothing, and never give it back. Sometimes they just wouldn't pair voice, sometimes they would just never let one of the PCs play audio.- Audio latency is really bad. I don't believe these support any Apt-X low latency codecs, so watching videos or movies is painful.- They would randomly paus whatever content I was watching, I think this was bad on-ear detection?- Not very comfortable compared to the plantronics.Now they're not all bad. The audio quality is definitely pretty good. The call quality was good enough.

The microphone also seems to work good during phone calls, etc.  The controls may be a bit difficult to use and takes time to get used to.  At first, you may have to take off the headphones to locate the controls you need.  The headphones link to your cell phone app, and has equalizers and noise cancellation options.  What I am surprised about these $130.00 Headphones, despite me playing around with the Equalizer to try to get the sound I want, my $29 and $39 Tuzo T6, T10, and $39 T12 Earbuds (not noise cancelling) have much better dynamic sound out of the box than these $130 headsets.  Just giving you the facts.  You can push software updates to the phone that can improve sound performance.  The Soundcore headphones have an unbeatable battery life of 40 to 50 hours -- insane.  I really like that!  For the Price, the Soundcore is not a bad deal, and if you know what you are doing (I am not an expert), you can get good sound of of them.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
335,Andy Mc,"These headphones check the boxes on almost everything I care about. The battery stays charged for days even with moderate use. The audio is great and the mic works very well. I was about to give a very strong 5 stars until 3 weeks ago.The noise cancelling developed a constant high frequency sound and there doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it. I work in a lab with a lot of constant humming from fans and ovens for hours a day. I really appreciated the noise cancelling while I had it.But the headphones are great, especially in terms of battery, and I would still recommend them... But with an asterisk.EDIT- Figured out what was wrong. The noise cancelling starts to do that humming thing when the battery is kinda low. Once I charged it again, the hum went away. Changed to 5 stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

337,Photo Chick,"Best noise cancellation (speakers / mic) and sound quality (for me / listeners) for web mtgs *and* for amazing sound for music/streaming!While each can be paired to multiple devices, my life is easier if I assign separately, sooooooI bought Q20, Q30x2, Q35; two wired Life U2 earbud pairs for tv streaming; and four pairs of Pro wireless earbuds: two Soundcore Liberty Air pairs - mic excellent for phone calls esp with  barking dogs; and two Liberty 2 Pro pairs that I loved but dogs ate left one of each - sigh. Gifted the Q20 to my niece and bought hubby a Q30. Yes, I highly recommend for listening and for being clearly heard on calls/WebEx/Teams!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
338,Ironsights,My grandsons all have bose and still borrow mine. Most people can’t hear all of the frequency response etc. and other high tech qualities of Bose These work as well as Bose for me.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
339,Jason,"Bought both the Sony WH-1000XM4 and these during Prime Days 2021.  Got the Sony and didn't like the lag that occurs when you use all the features, so bought these as well and enjoy them both.The Anker Life Q35 doesn't haven't the same lag problems, but the noise cancelling is FAR behind Sony.  The Sony are absolutely amazing at that function.Connecting multiple Bluetooth devices simultaneously is easy for both, but changing what is connected is much easier on the Sony using their app.NFC connection for both are seamless.LDAC quality is very close to each other.  Anker isn't lying about the audio quality, and is a huge selling point.To turn on LDAC on Android, open the device settings insidethe Bluetooth control panel.Highly recommend both Sony and Anker",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
340,stringtickler,"These are the best as far as fit goes, but they are lacking in features and the sound quality that I've come to expect from Soundcore.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
341,James H.,Great sound quality for a very good price.  Love the touch feature that takes you in and out of noise-canceling mode.  Very easy to connect bluetooth. Great battery life. Great value for the money!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
342,Robert E. Skinner,"While the Noise Cancelling is the best, of my limited experience, I suggest the Q30 because of something called Pause on Remove. In the gym, every grunt is rewarded with a pause. It is too sensitive. These are not supported by the Soundcore App on IOS where I expected to flash or tune. They will suggest you ""Try it on an Android"". Obviously, as an IOS user I should have paid MUCH more to get NFC and other things I miss now more than the $400+ dollar difference. These replaced some beloved Sony Over Ear that died after 8 years. Those were more comfortable and not feature ridden for this Audible - not Audiophile - user. So buy some stock in Apple and then just stick to their walled garden of products and you will eventually break even.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
343,Matt L,"Battery life is insane, i used it for study sessions of over 5 hours and it lasted a whole week before I had to charge it. I was using ANC the whole time and although its not the same as Bose or Sony's ANC, for the price, you can't beat it. It feels strong and resistant to snapping and the sound quality is amazing for its price! I hate having touch sensors on my headphones that my friend's Sony XM4's have because it is annoying to control, I rather have buttons to press that I can feel with my tactile senses and use.The biggest issue, which is very minor at best, is you need the app to control the ANC settings but you can always put it at Transport which is the highest and stop using the app ever.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
344,Russell Miller,"Update these and install the app and you'll be good to go. Out of the box, not so good though. The app makes all the difference. You will not find a headphone for this price that compares. These will give the Sony and Bose QC a run for their money easily. Save yourself some cash and just get these.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
345,Scott Graf,"These fit my head just fine, but every head is different.As to the sound quality I've listened to a few favorite albums and have not noticed any muddiness or lack of clarity, to the contrary I think that they sound great, considering they're bluetooth especially, though I have set them to use the LDAC codec.Podcasts also sound great, with no issues.They're comfortable and relatively lightweight. fine to wear at the gym, but probably not on a run. For commuting, walking around, and general use they are ideal.They feel high quality in the hand, and fold easily into the included carrying case.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
346,Kevin McGrath,These were a gift to myself and I haven't had a chance to use them yet. I dont believe in spending hundreds of dollars on a decent pair of noise cancelling headphones and I think these Anker Soundcores will do the job.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

348,Mike,"The packaging/presentation was great, app good, sound ok for me, NC ok. Not Bose quality but about 1/3 the price. But I was sweating around the ears in a short time. Spouse experienced the same. Couldn't wear for long. Returning today, gonna stick with buds.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
349,Scott S,"I purchased these to replace some JBL headphones that my wife decided to take out in the rain.  I don't know why she keeps going running when it's gonna rain, she claims she doesn't look at the weather first, but honestly she checks the weather 5 times a day, so I don't buy it.Anyway, these cost about the same as the JBL headphones, but have much better noise cancellation and better sound quality.  The battery life is pretty good, not amazing.  The noise cancellation is not as responsive as my airpod pros, but these are much more comfortable.  If you aren't insane about headphone quality, you'll be very happy with these.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
350,john,"Maybe it just my head size but have you ever wondered why all screen shots or pics of these headsets are taken from a side view.  I bought these for commuting and the sound is excellent.  The noise cancellation is very sub par and the ambient mode is just confusing.  These are hi res headphones and the quality of audio, in my opinion, is equal to or better than most.  The noise cancellation is not great and the ambient mode does very little.  Do yourself a favor and just get the lower priced Q20s.  They both sound the same, except for the overrated LDAC, which also does nothing for the audio..Soundcore please release a smaller model with Aptx HD!!!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
351,Tim ,What did I like and the life Q35. Honestly everything. I got these headphones for a trip I was taking with my family. I picked these up for $109. There was a 20 dollar off coupon. I got my 2 kids the soundcore 20 and I got my wife the new Bose QC 700. I wanted the noise cancelation and something you can plug in for inflight movies as well for all of us. For our flight. 10 hours is a long time. Comparing these to the my wife's Bose. I found these ( in my opinion ) sounded better. She even said the same. For a fraction of the price I am very impressed with these. Even the life 20 sounded very good. We even have the Bose QC buds and I find myself wearing these more. All in all these are a very good headphone. I would recommend to everyone looking for a sub 200 dollar headphone. I have had for a couple of months now and I can't find any Cons. If I do I'll update this post,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
352,Haulra,(UPDATED FOR 1 MONTH REVIEW)Everything below is about the same except the comfy earpads have almost fully deflated and is flat and not squishy anymore. For the price I would expect these pads to last at least 6 months....not 1.The cons stay the same as well.Bluetooth has become finicky where it will continuously pause and isn't intuitive.This is a review after a week of use.Pros:-Not $300-For the price this product does exactly what I expected it to.-Comfy ear pads don't get annoying after an 8 hour work day.-Bluetooth for one device is nice.Cons:-Noise cancelling could be better. It drowns out a little bit like white noise but you can still hear keyboard clicks and people talking.-Bluetooth to multiple devices can be improved. I am connected to my phone and computer. It will always default to my computer and when I am done with my computer and want to listen to my phone it doesn't always switch over automatically. only about 20% of the time.Final thoughts:If you want a good over the ear headphone with limited noise cancelling abilities but don't want to drop $300+ then these are a fit for you but if you want a good pair of noise cancelling headphones then you might want to increase your budget a little bit.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
353,Ray Woo,"Anker Q35 is equipped with many features including decent ANC, battery life, decent sound, and comfort.While its ANC isn't as strong as Sony's latest model or Bose, it is pretty good enough for the price and only slightly behind Bose's capability.Like many Anker sound products, this model comes with the U shaped sound signature which may translate to 'clear' and bassy sound. To me, I need to turn down the treble range so that it doesn't hurt my ears, and it is easy to do so with its app. I do turn up the middle and lower the treble so it sounds more balanced for me.Around $100, this headphone is really hard to beat. It provides so much that one may need. Sound (it sounds sharp but can be fixed via their app), comfort, battery life.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
354,Me,"I compared these to Bose 45s and here is my thoughts. Controls and sound are better for Bose 45s. Microphone is better for soundcore 35s. Charge and battery life is equal. Cost:quality ratio, soundcore 35s win by a long shot.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Black
355,KayBee,"Everything came as stated, headphones, case, adapter, USB C cable and 3.5mm cable, all in a very nice box. Instructions are easy to follow and setup the Q35s. The 3 noise canceling modes are noticeably different with the interior office/home mode very appropriate for stated use. The noise cancelation is very effective so far, have not been able to try out outdoors or transportation modes. The battery life is excellent; over 5 hours use on initial charge with nary a dent in battery capacity. Decent sound quality, very good for the price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue

357,Alexander Padalino,"I have had these headphones for about a week now.Overall, the sound quality is nice and if you have music on the ANC seems decent for the price. My main negative for these, is that whenever I turn them on for the first ten minutes or so my music with keep intermittently pausing as if I am moving or taking them off my ear. It happens when I am sitting stationary at my desk.Not sure if this is just a faulty pair. Otherwise, they seem like a decent pair of headphones, but it's annoying to have to keep pushing play on my music for the first ten minutes after putting them on.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
358,Ravi,Excellent for sound. Noise canceling is average.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
359,Shawn Pacarar,"Let me start by saying I do like these headphones for listening to music. They are good at bringing out the best in a song and noise cancelling works well.BUT, I enjoy making music as well and sometimes the sound in this headset just isn’t pure enough. Using the unpowered mode directly plugged in, the sound still feels like it’s still not a flat sound. When I’m mixing music it’s important to me to get the most raw and pure sound out of a pair of headphones or speakers so I can make my music sound better across any quality of speaker.EDIT: After getting a different pair of headphones and using these for longer, I'm realizing that these have a fairly loud ring to them that gives me a headache after prolonged use. The ringing also sticks in my ears for LONG after I stop using them as well, so this is severely troublesome and I'm thinking about getting rid of them. I believe it has something to do with the ambient noise cancelling, but this is present in all of the modes. I'm not changing my 3 star rating, but I definitely would not recommend these headphones after using them for some time.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Blue
